<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>SEO &amp; PPC Audits</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">There is one certainty with SEO and PPC; as algorithms continue to evolve there will always be something new to adjust to. As Google and other search engines begin to understand the context behind how prospects search on Google, the more SEO and PPC will continue to shift towards using intent-driven strategies to move the needle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The best way to understand the search landscape is to start with an audit, to see how your website is performing in search engine results and gain competitive intelligence in your online vertical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">SEO is still a long-term strategy, but it can result in a high ROI over time. As real-time rankings continue to increase in speed, higher authority domains can penetrate the top search results faster. This is why it’s so important to have an ongoing SEO growth strategy in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">PPC can be a short and long-term strategy based on your goals, but it works best when used for the long term for campaigns that prove out a positive ROI. PPC can offer fast levers to promote current products, services, and special offers that drive users to a dedicated landing page designed for engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Here is a snapshot of what types of search intelligence our SEO and PPC audits deliver.</span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Competitive research for Google Ads, organic performance and market share opportunities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Local search recommendations for improvement</span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Why is SEO Important? These SEO Statistics Explain Why</b></span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The 1st 5 organic positions in Google account for 95% of all clicks, as of May 2021, according to data from </span><a href="https://www.advancedwebranking.com/ctrstudy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced Web Ranking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">.

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Google processes over 3.5 billions search queries per day, according to </span><a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet Live Stats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">. This statistic shows that top visibility on page 1 in Google is a big factor to drive traffic to your site, build website authority, and connect more prospects with your brand.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">15% of daily search queries are new, according to </span><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">. This makes SEO an ongoing tactic, so content that is written in a format of how people naturally speak will help Google to better understand the context and intent, which places your website in a better position to rank for these new queries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The first organic result on a Google SERP has a 28.5% </span><a href="https://www.highervisibility.com/blog/how-to-improve-organic-click-through-rates-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">click-through rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">, according to the article posted b</span>y </span><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-first-page-clicks/374516/#close"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engine Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">. By the time you get to the 10th result, the CTR has fallen to 2.5%. This stat shows that the higher you rank organically the more website traffic you stand to gain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">According to</span> </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/26/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-are-almost-constantly-online/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">85% of Americans say they go online on a daily basis.

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Step 2: Understand the Internal Marketing Landscape</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To increase your brand visibility online, it’s important to first understand the current marketing landscape.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Historically, what marketing tactics have driven qualified leads?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">What percentage of gross revenue is allocated to marketing?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Does your website make it easy for prospects to understand your business?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Is there an incentive for prospects to take the action and reach out?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Does your website lead data integrate into your CRM?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Do you have full access to your website?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">How many leads do you currently generate from organic &amp; paid channels?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">What is the lead nurturing process currently? Email drip campaigns, etc.?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.webstrategiesinc.com/blog/how-much-budget-for-online-marketing-in-2014" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Strategies, Inc.</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">,</span> a recent Forrester Research report projects that digital marketing will make up approximately 45% of all ad spend in 2020. Of course, the number can vary depending on factors that include industry, growth plans and local market. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Due to the pandemic, businesses have unused marketing budgets that were previously allocated to events, trade shows, print, outdoor and in-store advertising, and more. This budget should be shifting towards digital, which is currently under-funded given the amount of time people are spending online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once you understand your internal marketing landscape, you will be able to determine any barriers to defining the internal and external resources you need to help the lead generation strategy process move forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Examples could be improved tracking capabilities, outsourcing digital marketing to specialists, improving access to your website and understanding MarTech processes.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Step 3: Determine the Right Digital Strategy</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">As prospects and customers are working from home, they are spending even more time on Google, Facebook and YouTube, so being visible on these major platforms are a key to lead gen success online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Now that you understand your current marketing landscape, you can start to determine your ideal lead generation goals. Then, you can apply formulas to find the best digital strategy for your business.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Define lead goals to drive marketing qualified leads to result in business growth</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Lead goals should be defined for specific services or products</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Gain competitive intelligence on top online competitors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Determine test budgets by channel, driven by leads needed to drive profit</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Develop a channel strategy, beginning with baselines</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Outline the entire prospect experience (messaging, offers, landing page, tracking)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Tactic plan set up (SEM: Google Ads, FB Ads, etc. | SEO: Geo, SERP features, etc.) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Set up tracking for each channel</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Set up reporting for each channel</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Manage and optimize for ongoing learning, improvement and long-term strategy</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">There are channel formulas you can use to begin to set your test budgets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For paid advertising, this is a good one to start with. You can either apply historial campaign data from or start with industry benchmarks and adjust based on your actual test campaign data. This is where your specialized digital agency or in-house resources can refine performance to improve these metrics over time which ultimately contribute to driving more business growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">(Leads x Avg CPC) / Avg Conversion Rate = Media Spend</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">You can also monitor the profitability of advertising campaigns and platforms using this lead generation formula. The actual data, gained from your testing strategy, will allow you to see how profitable paid advertising can be in driving business growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">((Conversion Leads) * (Average Lead Close Rate) * (Average Value per Close) * (Profit Margin)) – Cost = Profit</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once you define the right approach to develop the best strategy per channel, you’ll be able to determine the expertise needed to be positioned for success, setting milestones and leveraging specialists to deliver on business growth.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As marketers, our biggest challenge at the beginning of a PPC marketing campaign is to determine the best approach to define and measure the outcome for success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The front-end process combines research, understanding who your audience is, obtaining quality competitive intelligence, and then developing campaigns which include installing tracking, A/B testing and deployment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Setting expectations to deliver on clearly defined goals up-front is critical for the success of the campaign. Defining performance metrics and how they get measured and reported before the campaign launch, can make or break the long-term performance.</span></p>
<h2><b>What PPC Metrics Matter?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In today’s data driven world, we have access to many digital metrics. It seems like it should be very straight forward to get the data we need, which it typically is, but the differentiator are the insights from the data that drive benefits and actions that will improve performance. </span></p>
<h2><b>Ad Level Metrics &#8211; You Have to Start Somewhere</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you&#8217;re just starting a campaign, many marketers begin with ad level metrics that give insights into your campaign performance and website traffic, especially since over 60% of campaigns we review don’t have the right conversion tracking set-up.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first glance in looking at ad level data for these three example campaigns, campaign B seems to drive the lowest traffic volume at the highest cost. It appears this campaign is driving the most expensive clicks compared to the other two, so based on this view we may consider pausing this campaign.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-876 size-large" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-1-1024x315.png" alt="" width="1020" height="314" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-1-1024x315.png 1024w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-1-300x92.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-1-768x236.png 768w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-1.png 1423w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></p>
<h2><b>Response Level Metrics &#8211; Conversions Are The Next Step</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Setting up conversion tracking can be complicated and tricky. If you are lucky enough to have this set-up correctly or work with an agency that sets conversion tracking up properly, you can start to see lead response data and look for any outliers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are a lot of conversion tracking options that should be defined and properly set-up. If you work with an agency they should define them prior to the PPC advertising campaign launch. Starter examples of meaningful conversions can include online purchases, form submissions, phone calls, downloads and clicks within the website using event tracking.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-875 size-large" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-2-1024x369.png" alt="" width="1020" height="368" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-2-1024x369.png 1024w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-2-300x108.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-2-768x277.png 768w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-2.png 1397w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at these three campaigns above, campaign C has the lowest cost per conversion with campaign A costing the most, but we still don’t have insights into which of these leads actually took an action and then moved down the funnel and became a customer. </span></p>
<h2><b>Revenue Level Metrics &#8211; Maximize Performance &amp; Eliminate Wasted Media Spend</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Understanding which leads are resulting in revenue can help direct and maximize advertising media spend and sales performance. These metrics also help us prove the value of marketing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are also a lot of things that impact a lead that turns into a customer like the quality of the CRM data that is entered and making sure attribution is factored in all along the customer journey. It can also get even more complicated with offline purchases and longer complex sales cycles, compared to e-commerce, which requires further collaboration and tracking efforts.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the example below, we factored in all additional costs which included media spend plus the agency monthly management fee, and you can see that campaign B is the clear winner, generating more sales at a lower CPA (cost-per-acquisition) with the most revenue and the highest marketing ROI.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-877 size-large" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-3-1024x334.png" alt="" width="1020" height="333" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-3-1024x334.png 1024w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-3-300x98.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-3-768x250.png 768w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Table-3.png 1408w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tracking PPC ROI metrics can give valuable insights to the bottom line impact from directly trackable leads. Many times, a well implemented PPC advertising strategy across multiple platforms like Google, Bing and Facebook can also create a lift in response from other channels like organic or direct, so assigning attribution to all touch points from the lead to customer journey can give the best overview of proving the value of marketing efforts over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking your PPC advertising campaigns to the next level is very possible if you have the right data to gain the right insights to eliminate waste and provide the maximum return on your online advertising investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are struggling with tracking the right ROI metrics for PPC advertising, you&#8217;re not alone, it&#8217;s a complex process! </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-356" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Banner-for-Content-Marketing-Series.png" alt="" width="559" height="214" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Banner-for-Content-Marketing-Series.png 820w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Banner-for-Content-Marketing-Series-300x114.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Banner-for-Content-Marketing-Series-768x292.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Creating online content does not always equate to <em>writing</em> online content. While blog posts are effective tools to help build and reinforce a company’s online presence, other formats have emerged in recent years that brands should begin to explore and capitalize on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">We’ve all watched as social media has revolutionized the Internet, and marketers have taken note. For several years, companies have used social media to encourage consumers to interact with their brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Throughout these years, one type of post has distinguished itself as particularly effective at engaging consumers, sparking a recent trend among online marketers that emphasizes this type of content on social media and beyond.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-358 size-full" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Infographics.png" alt="Infographics header" width="820" height="312" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Infographics.png 820w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Infographics-300x114.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Infographics-768x292.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000000">Infographics</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Visual content has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years; <strong>infographics</strong> in particular have become a favorite medium among online marketers. Infographics offer a visual, creative, and concise way to convey information. According to <span style="color: #000080"><a style="color: #000080" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2017/10/19/the-data-is-in-infographics-are-growing-and-thriving-in-2017-and-beyond/#6010ac0d137c">Forbes</a></span>, 84% of marketers who have used infographics consider them an effective tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Infographics incorporate visual aids such as icons, graphs, images, and flow charts. By transforming data into a visual story, infographics simplify information and deliver it in an appealing and understandable manner. Online marketers can utilize this type of content to, for example, summarize a blog post, explain how to use a product, compare two types of services, or illustrate results from a customer satisfaction survey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-360 size-full" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Video.png" alt="Video header" width="820" height="312" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Video.png 820w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Video-300x114.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Video-768x292.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000000">Video</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In addition to infographics, <strong>video</strong> has surfaced as an increasingly popular type of visual online content. Live video in particular is being heralded as an up-and-coming medium. In a world where it’s sometimes difficult to tell the difference between what’s real and what’s manufactured, live video, which streams in real-time, has a sense of authenticity that appeals to viewers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Companies looking to capitalize on the rise of video should create interesting videos that align with their brand and relate to consumers. For example, a short live video of employees brainstorming during a meeting could make a fun Facebook post that highlights your company’s personality, while also hinting at your creative process. A recorded video of a customer giving positive testimony about your brand could supplement a new blog post about the company’s commitment to customer service.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-359 size-full" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Podcasts.png" alt="Podcasts header" width="820" height="312" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Podcasts.png 820w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Podcasts-300x114.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Podcasts-768x292.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000000">Podcasts</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Visual content does not represent the only format becoming increasingly prevalent among marketers, however. <strong>Podcasts</strong> rely on auditory content to connect with consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Podcasts integrate commentary and conversation into different “episodes” that focus on various topics, all of which relate to an overall theme—for example, a shoe company with a podcast might have episodes highlighting new fashion trends, NBA players who design their own shoes, and the most popular shoes throughout different eras of history.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Although podcasts typically have one or two consistent hosts, the episodes can feature interviews with guests and other creative forms of engagement. Hosts can even answer questions that listeners of the podcast pose on Twitter or Facebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Podcasts can be streamed or downloaded by consumers, who can listen to episodes in the car, during downtime at work, or while walking around the neighborhood. This form of content can increase your brand awareness by engaging those interested in the topics you cover, and exposing them to your company as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">These various tools have emerged in recent years, providing companies the chance to expand into new and creative territories. To gain a competitive edge, your brand should begin capitalizing on these new opportunities as a supplement to the content you may already be producing, such as blog posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Regardless of which tools you choose to delve into, be sure to keep your marketing strategy and branding <strong>consistent</strong> among all platforms and formats.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s face it. As Local Business owners, we wear so many hats, and sometimes it feels like there aren’t enough hours in the day to devote to managing online listing platforms and growing positive 5-star reviews on Google My Business or other review sites.</p>
<p>Today’s customers expect to find and engage with your local brand quickly and easily. These tips will help you maximize your online marketing results so you can connect and engage with more potential customers and save time doing it.</p>
<h2><strong>Get 5-Star Google My Business </strong><strong>Reviews </strong><strong>– How to Start</strong></h2>
<p>The more times your business&#8217; name appears online on relevant platforms, the faster you will see your search rankings improve. Better yet, if you are getting reviews, research has shown they improve click-thru-rate by as much as 20%.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick way to to ask your happy customers for a review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for your business&#8217; name on Google.</li>
<li>Click on &#8216;Write a Review&#8217; on your Google My Business Listing.</li>
<li>Copy that URL, paste it in <a href="https://goo.gl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s URL shortener tool</a>, and add the number 5 after the final comma in the link.</li>
<li>Copy the shortened URL and email the link to your happy client list, asking for a review. The link starts them at a 5-star pop up window so they can write a review and adjust the ratings if they want to.</li>
<li>Customers will have to sign into their Gmail account and will be prompted to do that automatically. If they don’t have one, they can sign up quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-270 size-full" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2017-09-01-at-3.06.21-PM.png" alt="Google My Business 5 Star Review " width="556" height="363" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2017-09-01-at-3.06.21-PM.png 556w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2017-09-01-at-3.06.21-PM-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></p>
<h3><strong><u>Bonus</u></strong></h3>
<p>Getting good reviews on Google My Business sends trust signals to potential customers that see your listing and can start to build initial positive brand signals with a soon-to-be customer. In fact, 72% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations, according to Review Monitoring.</p>
<h2><strong>Managing Google My Business Reviews – Positive and Negative</strong></h2>
<p>It’s very important to monitor your brand online for any negative reviews. A quick and free way to do this is to use <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Alerts</a>. For Google My Business, if you claim your listing, then you will get notified whenever someone leaves a review. If you need help optimizing other areas of your page, check out our <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/2017/07/28/business-optimized-google-business-listing-bing-places-business/">Google My Business</a> article to get more tips.</p>
<p>To demonstrate good customer service and show that you care about customers past the sale, you should respond to both positive and negative reviews.</p>
<p>For positive reviews, you should always respond as quickly as possible. Thank customers for their business and for taking the time to leave a review, and restate what they were happy with. It’s a good idea to mention your company name and use any relevant keywords.</p>
<p>For negative reviews, you should start by responding quickly, thanking them for their feedback, and telling them you will be reaching out directly to resolve the issue. After reaching out directly offline, make every attempt to resolve the issue. Once it’s resolved, respond online describing how the issue was rectified, and hopefully the customer will adjust their rating (which you can ask for during the resolution conversation).</p>
<h3><strong><u>Bonus</u></strong></h3>
<p>According to a new study from Northwestern University’s Spiegel Research Center, interacting with negative reviews leads to consumers spending four times longer on sites and boosts conversion rates by 67%.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>Building a solid local brand and promoting it online takes time. These review management tips can help you turn happy and unhappy customers into brand advocates. Nurturing customers past the sale is critical to building long-term customer relationships, which always leads to invaluable word-of-mouth advertising – the highest compliment a business can receive!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are distinct differences between how a small business should approach B2B marketing versus B2C marketing.</p>
<p>Here are some key differences a small business can evaluate and use to jumpstart the development of a marketing plan and strategy.</p>
<h2><strong>#1 &#8211; Syncing Marketing Touchpoints to the Sales Cycle</strong></h2>
<p>In B2B marketing, typically there are multiple decision makers in the chain of command, so the sales cycle takes longer. It helps to have an internal champion that believes your product or service is best suited to solve their business need or problem (<em>example: patent attorney law firm services</em>).</p>
<p>In B2C marketing, typically there is one decision maker. For this reason, the sales cycle is shorter for more inexpensive products or services and longer for more expensive products or services (<em>example: senior living community services</em>). Trust signals like reviews and the influence of others who have experience with your brand can really help win over new customers on the consumer side.</p>
<h2><strong>#2 &#8211; Evaluating Audience Size: Business vs. Consumer </strong></h2>
<p>Another major difference is that consumer audiences are typically much larger than business audiences.</p>
<p>Appealing directly to consumers on a larger scale can be expensive, so developing customer personas is a critical first step. Then, research where your audience spends time, and evaluate the best mediums to use in order to target them throughout the entire customer journey funnel (upper, middle and bottom). Focus groups can also be very helpful. Furthermore, digital channels like <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/complete-guide-to-ppc-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0763a8;">PPC</span></a> can help scale your reach.</p>
<p>For B2B efforts, appealing directly to the appropriate businessperson at your target company can also be expensive. It can take multiple touch points to pique their interest and prompt them to explore if your product or service is the right fit for their organization. The business audience size also varies by industry. It is typically much more of a niche marketing effort, so market research can point you in the right direction and save on costly mistakes.</p>
<h2><strong>#3 &#8211; Content &amp; Messaging</strong></h2>
<p>Developing a content plan for the B2B audience should be much more educational, with information highlighting key business improvements and backed up by data and research, if possible. Companies are looking for expertise, so this makes nurturing very effective. Good tactics to start with are email automation, paid search and display retargeting.</p>
<p>Developing a content plan for the B2C audience should be much more focused on personal benefits, ideally backed up by influencer marketing. Consumers are looking for deals, and they gravitate towards entertaining content. Thus, a good channel to start with is social media platforms.</p>
<p>Marketing and sales roles are evolving, and there has never been a better time to use new channels to support your sales efforts.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>What is Google My Business?</strong> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">GMB is a visual snapshot of your business listing that appears on google search and maps. If you’ve recently started a business or are in need of growing your digital presence, this is a great place to start. Bing Places for Business mimics GMB, but of course will display on Bing’s search engine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">GMB is also known as the google knowledge panel. When a prospect or customer performs a brand search (your company name + location) it should display your business in the top right-hand corner of the page, ultimately giving the user a first impression of your business&#8230;before visiting your website. There are more in-depth features which we’ve outlined below, but let’s address the basic features first:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Displaying photos of your logo, employees, building, services, inventory, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">The service you offer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Phone number</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Website link</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Directions link</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Hours</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why should you be optimizing GMB? Here are 4 great reasons.</strong></h2>
<p><b>Reviews</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. If you’ve already made a great first impression but your prospect is still evaluating your brand, it’s now your job to gain their trust. GMB displays your customer reviews, which are sure to help (if they’re not positive we can help change that).</span></p>
<p><b>Posts</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Google just released this feature and it allows you to create a ‘post’ which appears on your listing giving you the option to advertise specials, sales, discounts, events, etc. This is a solid feature as it&#8217;s a great display advertising method to use before a customer even clicks on your website, see an example below:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-154 size-full" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Google-My-Business-GMB-Post-Creative-Website-Marketing.png" alt="Google My Business Post" width="540" height="623" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Google-My-Business-GMB-Post-Creative-Website-Marketing.png 540w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Google-My-Business-GMB-Post-Creative-Website-Marketing-260x300.png 260w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p><b>Message Button</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Link your phone number to the message button and your prospect/customer now has the ability to make one click and send you a direct message (showing up in text message style). This is currently a mobile only feature.</span></p>
<p><b>Link Other Social Media Pages</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Bing Places for Business lets you link to your Facebook and Twitter pages. Who doesn’t want more likes and followers, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you have multiple business locations or are still not sure how to make the most of your GMB or Bing Places for Business listing? <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline" href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/#contact">Contact us</a></span></span> </strong>or learn more about us on <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline" href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our site</a>,</span></span> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and let’s talk about how our team can help your business.</span></p>
