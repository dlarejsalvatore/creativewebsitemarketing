]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year in August we talked about the shift mobile devices have created and how Google planned to implement the mobile-first index. You can read our <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/2017/08/14/mobile-seo-part-2-are-you-ready-for-googles-mobile-first-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous post here</a>, but for a quick review, the mobile-first index means Google will now be ranking its search listings based on the mobile version of content (on your website), even for listings that are shown to desktop users.</p>
<p>According to searchengineland.com, Google announced that it has finally begun the process of rolling out the mobile-first index to more sites. If you haven’t yet optimized for this, rest assured that this rollout is only for sites that follow best practices (as of now).</p>
<h2><strong>What Do You Need To Do?</strong></h2>
<p>Google plans on notifying webmasters and site owners of the migration thru the Google Search Console. You can expect to see a message like the example below for your website once the change has been made.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-338 size-full aligncenter" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/hurray-mfi-party.png" alt="Google Search Console message" width="625" height="292" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/hurray-mfi-party.png 625w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/hurray-mfi-party-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll actually be able to check out your <strong>‘Index Coverage’</strong> on all the pages of your website and see what pages show errors (hopefully zero), are valid but have warnings, are valid, or excluded.</p>
<p>In addition to the index coverage, you can access a performance dashboard to review a few relevant metrics that might be a little easier to understand than thru Google Analytics. Not familiar with Google Search Console (or Google Analytics)? Get in touch with us <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/#contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and we can help change that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-349 aligncenter" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2018-03-26-15.01.00-1.png" alt="Index Coverage" width="623" height="300" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2018-03-26-15.01.00-1.png 913w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2018-03-26-15.01.00-1-300x145.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2018-03-26-15.01.00-1-768x370.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We feel it&#8217;s fair to expect the change in indexing to be implemented in full by May of this year (2018). Make sure you aren’t left behind!</p>
<p>If you would like to analyze your mobile strategy for your site, feel free to connect with us through our <span style="color: #0000ff"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/#contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</strong></span> We’ll be happy to discuss your business and provide an online marketing strategy to meet your digital needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Two things our team at Creative Website Marketing do extremely well are helping companies increase their <strong>brand awareness</strong> and <strong>lead generation</strong> efforts.

We utilize digital marketing techniques to execute these objectives, and believe a digital strategy can be effective for 99% of all businesses. Chances are, you fall into that category. Are you taking advantage of everything digital marketing has to offer?

Not sure of the impact increasing your digital presence can have? Check out these <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stats</a> to determine if you are missing out on opportunities to generate more business online.
<h2><b>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)</b></h2>
According to Econsultancy,<b>&nbsp;</b>for every $92 spent acquiring customers, only $1 is spent converting them. It&#8217;s key to put yourself in your prospect&#8217;s shoes and test all of your landing pages. Ongoing A/B testing should be part of your online marketing strategy to maximize your investment in Digital marketing.
<h2><b>Organic Search</b></h2>
71% of B2B researchers start their research with a generic search, according to Google. Google receives about 3.5 billion search queries a day. Of those queries, 500 million or about 15% are new each day, so continued optimization and keyword research is key for a healthy organic strategy.
<h2><b>Pay-Per-Click (PPC)</b></h2>
64.6% of people click on Google ads when they are looking to buy an item online, so a strong paid search strategy is highly important if you are trying to sell a product or generate leads for an offline purchase. For keywords with high commercial intent, clicks on paid search listings beat out organic clicks by an approximate 2:1 margin in the US, according to WordStream.
<h2><b>Content Strategy</b></h2>
According to a recent Demand Gen Report,&nbsp;96% of B2B buyers want content from industry thought leaders. Also,&nbsp;47% of buyers viewed 3-5 pieces of content before engaging with a sales rep. Whether you have a B2B or B2C business, you should have a solid content strategy to connect with your prospects across their buyer journey in order to win more customers.
<h2><b>Social Media</b></h2>
90% of all marketers stated that social media has generated more exposure for their businesses, according to Social Media Examiner. An engaging social media strategy can increase brand awareness for your business and strengthen brand loyalty. In turn, this creates more long-term and repeat customers.
<h2><b>Mobile Search</b></h2>
Business Insider recent reported that&nbsp;Google drives 95% of all paid search ad clicks on mobile.<b>&nbsp;</b>Also,&nbsp;55.79% of Google searches take place on mobile devices compared to 44.21% on computers.

These mobile search trends clearly show that people are searching more often on their mobile devices, and that paid search ads can get your business in front of more potential customers in today&#8217;s mobile world.
<h2><b>Marketing Analytics</b></h2>
Hubspot recently shared that<b>&nbsp;</b>72% of organizations that calculate ROI say their marketing strategy is effective. As data collection and analysis advances, marketers will be able to show more ROI on trackable digital marketing efforts to help guide their businesses to invest in the right channels that produce desired results.
<h2><b>Local SEO</b></h2>
Google reported recently that 28% of searches for something nearby result in a purchase, and according to Search Engine Land, 78% of local mobile searches result in offline purchases. WordStream recently stated that 72% of consumers who did a local search visited a store within five miles.

These trends confirm that developing a Local SEO strategy has never been more important to drive online and offline purchases, as well as foot traffic.
<h2><b>Marketing Automation</b></h2>
This year, HubSpot stated that 70% of marketers believe that converting leads is their top priority.<b>&nbsp;</b>Also, nearly 70% of businesses are using a marketing automation platform or are currently implementing one. Savvy marketers appear to be utilizing technology to strengthen their digital strategy and drive real business results, making marketing automation a key tool in developing an overall marketing plan.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000">If your business doesn&#8217;t specialize in digital marketing, it can be difficult to measure whether or not your in-house advertising efforts are paying off. The following 5 questions can help you determine how effective your current online marketing strategies are, as well as offering tips &amp; tools for boosting results. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000"><b>1. What can a prospect find out about you from a single brand search on Google? </b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Open a Private Window from Safari or a New Incognito Window in Chrome, and search your company’s name on Google. Don’t include the company location or additional keywords. An incognito search will show what your customers are seeing, as it doesn’t take into account your computer&#8217;s search history.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Ideally, your search will include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Your website ranked #1 or 2 on the first page</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Your Google My Business listing</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">3 to 5 of your social media pages or other online platforms</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000">If your brand search doesn’t produce these results, there are several possible reasons as to why:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Your website needs an SEO boost</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Google thinks the content on your website isn’t relevant to the product or service you offer</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Your website isn’t mobile friendly (making it responsive will help)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Your Google My Business listing isn’t claimed and optimized</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Your business isn’t on social media</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Your social media profiles are not up-to-date</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000">When your brand is searched online, the goal is for your brand to take up the most real estate as possible on the 1st page of results.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000"><b>2. How much content are you producing on a weekly basis?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Whether you’re B2B or B2C, creating lots of content can have an enormous impact on growing your online presence. Types of content to share include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Blogs (publish on your website, then share throughout your social media platforms)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Company Updates</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Achievements</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Stories</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Pictures</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Videos</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Infographics</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">Team Member Bios (human factor)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Take inventory of how much you’re currently producing and sharing on a weekly basis. Multiply by 4 to get your monthly total and then by 52 for a yearly total. Given that everything you share online is helping to advertise your brand, and most likely you’re using FREE platforms, are you happy with how you are utilizing social media and online platforms from a content standpoint? Take advantage!</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000"><b>3. What online platforms can your brand be found advertising on? </b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000">First off, make sure you’re targeting platforms where your customers can be found. Online platforms doesn’t mean just social media. It also includes Google My Business, Bing Places for Business, Yellow Pages, Better Business Bureau, Wikipedia, etc. Use the image below to determine which platforms are right for your brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><img class="wp-image-298 aligncenter" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/14602224496_c3cebc398b_b-1024x791.jpg" alt="Social Media apps" width="637" height="492" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/14602224496_c3cebc398b_b.jpg 1024w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/14602224496_c3cebc398b_b-300x232.jpg 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/14602224496_c3cebc398b_b-768x593.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000"><b>4. Are you targeting your ideal customer profile?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000">If you can see demographics for the audience your brand is reaching, then you know if that audience fits your ideal customer profile or not. Within digital marketing, <b>Google Adwords</b> and <b>Social Media Paid Ads</b> are tools where you can specifically choose the demographics, audience location, and time of day you’d like to advertise to your ideal customer.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000"><b>5. Can you measure your ROI? </b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000">How much money have you spent? Maybe you haven’t spent any money, but your time still has a cost associated to it. Is it measurable?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">If not, let&#8217;s start a conversation to see how our team can help collaborate on your marketing efforts and increase your return on investment.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google is providing all the right digital tools for your local business to thrive online in today&#8217;s competitive digital advertising landscape. Their most recent feature now allows businesses to post <b>Questions &amp; Answers</b> on their local listing on Google.</p>
<h2><b>Questions &amp; Answers on Mobile Browsers</b></h2>
<p>Q &amp; A style content is not a new concept for marketers, but the ability to add questions and answers on your business&#8217; local listing on Google is. Initially rolled out for Android devices only, the Q &amp; A feature is now available on all mobile browsers.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-250 aligncenter" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/QA-Blog-Image-300x135.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="135" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/QA-Blog-Image-300x135.jpeg 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/QA-Blog-Image.jpeg 707w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>As straightforward as this is, it provides an additional touchpoint to gain trust with your customers and provide them with the relevant and reliable information they need in order to improve their search experience, directly from you, the business owner.</p>
<h2><b>Are You Taking Advantage?</b></h2>
<p>Help your customers during their search process to find the most accurate and up-to-date information. To take advantage of the feature, go ahead and add your business&#8217; frequently asked questions to your listing. Also, if your business is claimed on GMB, you’ll receive notifications once a customer asks a question, so you can post an answer.</p>
<p>Not sure what Google My Business is or if your business is claimed?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The shift to mobile devices has caused Google to change the methodology behind how it indexes and ranks websites. Google&#8217;s answer: mobile-first index. This shift needs to be a driving factor of your mobile SEO strategy.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s new mobile-first index means Google will now be ranking its search listings based on the mobile version of content, even for listings that are shown to desktop users.</p>
<p>Google wants their results to represent and reflect the majority of their users, which as of April 2017 is <strong>55.79% mobile users</strong> and 44.21% desktop (<a href="https://www.stonetemple.com/mobile-vs-desktop-usage-mobile-grows-but-desktop-still-a-big-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>). To get industry specific, the data below outlines the percentage of online searches on mobile devices by sector (<a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/attachment/percentage-of-online-searches-on-mobile-devices-by-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>). It&#8217;s important to note 8 out of 11 of these industries have a mobile search percentage of more than 50%.</p>
<ul>
<li>Food &amp; Beverage &#8211; 72%</li>
<li>Health &#8211; 68%</li>
<li>Sports &#8211; 68%</li>
<li>News &amp; Media &#8211; 64%</li>
<li>Lifestyle &#8211; 62%</li>
<li>Automotive &#8211; 62%</li>
<li>Retail &#8211; 56%</li>
<li>Travel (non-maps) &#8211; 52%</li>
<li>Real Estate/Property &#8211; 48%</li>
<li>Entertainment &#8211; 42%</li>
<li>Banking &#8211; 39%</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Can Your Business Do To Get Ready?</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a mobile site, or your current mobile site doesn’t reflect all the content on your desktop site, the solution may be simple. The most common and standard industry recommendation is to go with a <b>responsive website</b>. This way, the content is the same on a page by page view on your desktop and mobile site.</p>
<p>Utilize <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Search Console</a>. The search console will help you verify if your website is Google-friendly. Once adding your domain, you’ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze clicks from Google Search</li>
<li>Get alerts for critical errors or issues</li>
<li>Test whether Google can successfully understand your content</li>
</ul>
<h2>There Is Good News!</h2>
<p>If your mobile site needs work, the mobile-first index most likely isn’t rolling out until 2018, so you still have time to reanalyze your mobile strategy (but don’t wait too long).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As mobile users continue to grow, user behaviors and expectations will continue to change as well. If your business&#8217; mobile site hasn’t started receiving traffic or isn’t providing a friendly UX, it might be time to consider SEO options that will allow your mobile site to sustain and excel.</p>
<p>The differences between desktop and mobile includes many clear factors. Mobile provides a smaller screen, allows users to engage on the go, and use the internet at anytime, anywhere. But in regards to search queries, the mobile differences are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local search results are more likely in mobile</li>
<li>Autocomplete results appear before results in mobile searches</li>
<li>Voice searches are becoming more and more popular</li>
<li>Mobile searches have greater opportunities to provide more interactive results</li>
<li>One click to download apps</li>
<li>Mobile has different filters than desktop (fewer filters may mean higher click-thru-rates in mobile search)</li>
</ul>
<p>The mobile experience and interactions are what makes marketing and optimizing your mobile site a must for your potential customers. When developing your mobile strategy, it&#8217;s important to understand how Google analyzes the context, speed, and data of your mobile site.</p>
<h2><b>Context</b></h2>
<p>Google factors in the context of your phone when determining mobile search results. What does this mean? Things like the time, day of week, current month, info from your calendar, previous search history (that you&#8217;ve made available), are recognizable and detected in determining search rankings. The <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6155685?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search Analytics report </a>in the Google Search Console can help group your results by device, allowing you to view key metric differences.</p>
<h2><b>Speed</b></h2>
<p>Google ‘quick answers’ are now pulling in responses to search results directly. This means the speed, relevance and convenience of your mobile site is more important than ever. The <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Mobile Site Testing tool </a>will give you a score and solid insights regarding speed and where improvements should be made.</p>
<h2><b>Data</b></h2>
<p>Data analysis should drive your SEO strategy. How customers access your site, what they do when they get there (set trackable goals through Google Analytics), how long they stay, and where they leave from. Google Analytics can show you this information and gives you real time access to valuable user data.</p>
<h2><b>Don’t Forget To Stay Updated On Industry Trends</b></h2>
<p>Android Instant Apps is a clear indication of the direction the industry is going in. People don’t want to install and load separate apps; this initiative allows them to enjoy the benefits of apps without the drawbacks they typically bring. It is open to all developers now, so it is worth getting started if you haven’t done so already (<a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/instant-apps/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>).</p>
<p>The marketplace is more competitive than ever. Brands are constantly evolving and the competition can be stiff. Everybody has the access and ability to market their products and services but not everybody maximizes all their digital marketing efforts. Trends can change daily and unless you have an established marketing team, it&#8217;s too easy to fall behind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Content is what makes the internet go ‘round. The multiple variations of content (images, videos, text, etc) is what makes social media so engaging and online marketing a must for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Content marketing is a pretty easy place to start and just about anybody can do it — but before you take your product or service to the internet, you should think about your strategy and how to maximize your efforts to align with your overall business goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve outlined a few key components to help build your foundation and think about what types of content makes the most sense for your business and strategy.</span></p>
<h2><b>#1 &#8211; Web Pages and Profiles.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Web pages are the foundation for your content marketing efforts. This is your website, blog, Facebook page (facebook ads, facebook live), Twitter account, LinkedIn (company and personal pages), YouTube, Instagram, podcasts and any other relevant platform content is shared on. Your customers will not be active on every single platform, so track your engagement then focus on the channels that are yielding results. Don’t forget to maximize your reach so you can find customers from Twitter that you may not find on LinkedIn. Find the online space where your customers spend the most time and leverage the ability to share content there for free.</span></p>
<h2><b>#2 &#8211; Keep It Visual.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Images, videos, infographics and responsive links are what engages the user and creates memorial content. Be interactive. Facebook posts and Tweets with images still get more engagement than posts without images </span><span style="font-weight: 400">(<a href="https://venngage.com/blog/digital-marketing-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>). As of March 2017, infographics are performing better than any other type of content. Why? We suffer from information overload. 90% of info transmitted into our brains is visual</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> <a href="https://venngage.com/blog/digital-marketing-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(source</a>). Consider this the next time you want to share data.</span></p>
<h2><b>#3 &#8211; Call to Action.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s the point? What is the goal of each piece of content you create and share? If you want to grow your brand, engage your audience with info that they will like, share, and then they will follow you. Want to brand your company as the expert and build trust with your prospects? Provide valuable information that makes their life better. Are you asking someone to buy your product or service? Advertise using discounts or specials for first time customers. Advertising to repeat customers? Focus on telling them what their immediate need is and how you will solve their problem.</span></p>
<h2><b>#4 &#8211; Frequency.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’re putting out content and your customers and prospects are loving it, keep it coming. You know what you’re doing. If your engagement is still a little slow, shoot for creating really good material to share once or twice a week (if Instagram is your main contact with prospects, post every day). The point of a content marketing strategy is to get your brand circulating throughout the internet. Determine a frequency schedule and stick to it!</span></p>
<h2><b>#5 &#8211; Make It Convenient, Valuable and Relatable</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the most important! Break through the noise. Social media is convenient because everybody has apps on their phone. But how easy is it for an online user to get in contact with somebody at your company, schedule an appointment, or make a purchase? Your content should stand out because of the value it provides to your potential customers. Help solve their problems! Think of your different customer personas then create content that is relatable to your target market. Focus on the call to action and provide value!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If your current customers are interacting with you online and sharing how they use your product or service, or if they’re highlighting your brand, please please please highlight them! Turn them into a repeat customer and show the internet the value of your business offering.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Generating engagement and response for your business isn’t easy in the competitive world of Paid Search. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Google Adwords can quickly get your brand in front of your target audience’s eyeballs but in a competitive landscape on Google, PPC needs a solid strategy to win clicks and deliver lead response. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does your business have a Google Ads paid search campaign but no leads? Debbie Hill, CEO at Creative Website Marketing, shares her strategy insights to help rethink your Paid Search Strategy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Paid Search Strategy #1 &#8211; <strong>Start with a very specific goal</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the top ways to make a paid search campaign easier to tackle is to be clear on what success looks like. If you are a local service business and your goal is to gain more prospects, your strategy should include a customer lifecycle approach that connects with top of the funnel prospects and then guide them towards the bottom of the funnel where they can easily engage and respond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could start with 3 campaigns in Google Adwords that focus on ad groups that contain keywords that match the intent of Awareness, Consideration and Purchase in the customer lifecycle. These keywords should match pages on your website, so when a prospect clicks on your ad they have a relevant and positive experience so they are prompted to engage and reach out to your brand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A proper account structure will also set a solid foundation for your paid search campaigns to build a high Quality Score (1 &#8211; 10), the higher your score, the lower cost-per-click (CPC) you will be charged over time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Paid Search Strategy #2 &#8211; <strong>Include a strong message that differentiates your brand</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your ads and landing pages should demonstrate “why” your service is the best. Does your business and staff have a trusted reputation? If so it needs to be highlighted, so prospects can see themselves doing business with your brand. Once a prospect can see that your business can solve their problem or fill their need, you should have an offer that they can’t turn down.  Give a free service with a 6 month commitment, offer a free consultation, give a discount on the first engagement &#8211; you get the picture.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Paid Search Strategy #3 &#8211; <strong>Track &amp; analyze your campaign performance</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Google Adwords offers a lot of automation, so setting up conversion tracking for forms and phone calls will allow you to set automating bidding, so you can optimize bids for conversions or if your goal is traffic you can optimize for clicks. Linking to Google Analytics will also provide additional insights, using goals you can see the attribution for all channels and how they work together. This is really important since most website visitors don’t convert on the first or second visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This strategy can be applied to any paid search campaign and can be expanded for even more improvement using expanded ads, extensions, retargeting and gmail ads. There are new Adwords features all the time to take advantage of, so optimization should be an ongoing process to maximize performance and media spend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are running a current campaign and would like a second opinion from our seasoned Digital Marketing Experts, Creative Website Marketing is offering a </span><a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/#contact"><span style="font-weight: 400">FREE Digital Audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that includes a review of your Google Adwords campaign. We would be more than happy to give our opinion and provide improvement opportunities to help your campaign become more successful.</span></p>
