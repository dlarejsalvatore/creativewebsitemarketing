<h2><strong><span style="color: #000000;">How to Add Keywords in Google Ads</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Keywords help Google Ads determine when to serve up your ad on the search engine results page (SERP). Thus, your keywords should be pertinent to your business and relevant to the ads in your ad group.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing keywords typically involves keyword research through tools like Google’s </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword Planner</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or SEMRush. Once you’ve determined your keyword list, you’re ready to add them into Google Ads.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Follow the steps below to add keywords into your Google Ads search campaigns. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">On the campaign dashboard, you should be able to see all the campaigns in your account. Scroll to find the campaign into which you want to add keywords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">However, if you have a large number of campaigns in your account, it may be easier to use the search feature to find the campaign you’re looking for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Even if you’ve already conducted keyword research, the “Get Keyword Ideas” box can be helpful for a) validating the keywords you’ve already found and b) identifying new keywords you may have missed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To see keywords related to your business, you can enter your website or briefly describe your product or service, and click enter. This will generate keyword ideas for you in the box below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, if you’re creating a search campaign for plumbing services, your keyword idea list may look like the one pictured below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">You can click on any of the suggested keywords to add them to your keyword list.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;">5. Set Keyword Match Types</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The final step in this process is setting the keyword match types. </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The 3 match types in Google Ads are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Broad match</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Phrase match</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Exact match</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The graphic below from </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7478529" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlines the differences among the three match types.</span></span></p>

				<div class="col-inner"  >
			
			
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">As you can see, broad match lets your ads show for the widest variety of search queries related to your keyword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">On the other hand, exact match lets your ads show only on search queries that are exactly the same as your keyword, or have the same meaning as your keyword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Phrase match meets in the middle. For a phrase match keyword, your ads will not trigger for as wide a variety of searches. However, it is not as tight as exact match.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s helpful to note that even after you save your keyword list, you can change the match types at any time. Simply navigate to the </span>Keywords<span style="font-weight: 400;"> tab in the relevant campaign and ad group, then adjust the match type under the Match Type column.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In other words, you should set your match types when you create your keyword list, but you can always change them down the road based on performance.</span></p>

<h4><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Match Type Example:</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Let’s say you are a plumbing company advertising on Google Ads. The list below is an example of what your starter keyword list may look like with match types set.</span></p>

				<div class="col-inner"  >
			
			
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The first three keywords on the list are safe to leave as broad match. These keywords have clear intent, and the match type will let your ads be eligible to show for related searches, such as “best local plumbers” or “plumbing services near me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Meanwhile, you may choose to add “emergency plumber” as phrase match because the intent is more specific. Phrase match is tighter than broad match, so your ad might not show up for loosely related searches like “what is considered a plumbing emergency” or “is emergency plumbing more expensive.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">That’s a good thing, because you probably wouldn&#8217;t want to spend money on clicks from these search queries, which are more informational than purchase-driven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">However, adding this keyword as phrase match allows your ads to still be eligible to show for relevant searches like “emergency plumber near me” or “best emergency plumbers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, [plumbing repair] might work best as exact match, because there are a lot of variations of this keyword that could be irrelevant. For instance, leaving this keyword as broad match could cause your ads to show up for searches like, “why are plumbing repairs so expensive” or “diy plumbing repairs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Those searches don’t have strong commercial intent, so you probably wouldn’t want to pay for clicks from those users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Instead, users searching explicitly for “plumbing repair” or terms with the same meaning (i.e. “plumbing repair services”) would represent qualified traffic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Exact match allows you to capitalize on these searches while avoiding irrelevant searches like “most common plumbing repair questions.” </span></p>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Monitoring Search Terms</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">After your campaigns are up and running, it’s important to monitor the search terms report. The search terms report shows the actual search queries that have triggered your ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Why is this important? Google has come a long way in recognizing user intent and context. However, its algorithm isn’t perfect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Consequently, your ads may sometimes show up for irrelevant searches. This results in your company paying for clicks from users who are unlikely to engage with your website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, if you sell eyeglasses, one of your keywords might be “glasses near me.” As a result, your ads could potentially show up for searches such as, “wine glasses near me.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">If you’re spending money on those clicks, that’s wasted spend, because the user intent is not actually relevant to your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Thus, by browsing the search terms report, you can stay on top of which searches your ads are showing up for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">If you spot irrelevant queries in the search terms report, you can add them as negative keywords. Negative keywords prevent your ads from showing when someone includes a certain word or phrase in their search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For instance, in the eyeglasses example above, that advertiser should add “wine” as a negative keyword. As a result, their ads would not show for any searches containing “wine.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">This would save the advertiser money and reserve that budget for more relevant, higher intent searches.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>1. Be Helpful </b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The most important thing marketers can do when writing SEO content is to be helpful to the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Long gone are the days of stuffing exact match keywords into content wherever possible. Instead, Google has become much more adept at recognizing context and intent. Therefore, the exact words you use are not nearly as important as developing useful, thorough, and valuable content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In order to develop helpful content:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Anticipate questions users may have relating to the topic of your blog or web page </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Answer these questions in clear, easily understandable language</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Be thorough</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Demonstrate expertise by being accurate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Focus on providing value rather than selling a specific product or service</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Why is writing helpful content so important for SEO? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Google wants to serve up content that satisfies user intent, meaning it gives people the information they’re looking for. Thus, Google rewards content that provides the information someone is searching for in a clear, authoritative, and accessible way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Plus, when you help people find the information they’re looking for, it has benefits for your business. Helpful content builds trust between your brand and your audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">This can lead to engagement such as following you on social media, signing up for an email newsletter, inquiring about your services, browsing your product pages, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In other words, when you write helpful content, both Google and users will reward you for it.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>2. Identify Target Keywords</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">While being helpful is the ultimate goal of content creation today, it’s still important to target specific keywords in your writing. Identifying primary and secondary keywords allows you to hone in on your topic and keep your content focused on the specific questions users want answered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">You don’t need to force target keywords into every paragraph. Instead, focus on providing a wealth of information around your primary keyword. Use natural language that incorporates different variations of the target keyword or phrase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Additionally, don’t just target one keyword when writing SEO content. Incorporate secondary keywords as well. These are sub-topics that relate to your primary keyword and overall theme of the page. Oftentimes, these are longer tail keywords or questions that people searching for the primary keyword may also want to know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, say your primary keyword is “how to choose the best coffee machine.” This will be the main topic of your content. However, you can also address related sub-topics like “best coffee makers for occasional use,” “hi-tech coffee maker features,” and so on. These are secondary keywords that can be used as sub-headings to make your content more comprehensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">By expanding on your main topic and addressing related questions, your content will encompass a broader range of keywords. This can not only help you rank for a wider variety of queries, but it also reinforces your expertise on the subject, making your content more authoritative.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To identify target keywords, there are several research tools available such as SEMRush or WordStream’s </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free keyword tool</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, a great way to identify secondary keywords is to simply conduct Google searches. Search for your primary keyword, then browse the “people also ask” section and the related keywords at the bottom of the SERP.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>3. Include Visual Content</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In today’s online environment, users expect engaging visual content from brands. If your page is simply 800 words of plain text, it doesn’t matter how optimized or helpful the content is. Users will almost certainly navigate away to find a more engaging source of information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">As a result, Google will likely pick up signals that your page offers a poor experience, which can have a detrimental impact on SEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Thus, whether you’re writing a product page, blog post, or case study, visuals are an absolute must.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">High-quality images are a good starting point. In addition, consider using gifs, videos, graphs, or scrollable slides. These visuals not only help break up text but also expand the appeal of your content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For instance, when people are trying to learn and take in new information, some may prefer text while others prefer video. Some may be engaged by a humorous gif. Others may prefer to see charts and statistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Therefore, by including a variety of visuals in your content, you appeal to people with different learning styles and preferences. This helps you engage a wider array of users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Consequently, people may stay on your page longer and engage more with your site, which sends positive page experience signals to Google. This can help boost rankings.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>4. Ensure It’s Technically Sound</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Although the focus of content writing has shifted much more towards context and intent, the technical aspects of SEO are still important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For instance, a solid technical SEO foundation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Allows Google to more easily understand your content</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Keeps your page well organized</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Helps readability</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Can position you for featured snippets and other <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/how-the-search-engine-results-page-serp-is-changing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SERP features</a></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Prioritizes a strong user experience (UX)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Building a strong technical SEO foundation includes the appropriate use of subheadings, internal and external links, schema markup, image alt text, and more. In addition, it includes writing a meta description that provokes action, using transition words throughout your content, and checking for 404 errors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, UX is becoming more and more synonymous with SEO. Site speed and Core Web Vitals are now an integral part of a strong SEO foundation. Marketers can use tools like GTmetrix and </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google PageSpeed Insights</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assess a page’s performance and identify opportunities for improvement.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">As previously stated, content writing has changed a lot in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">However, technical SEO still serves a purpose. It can set your content up for success by, for example, organizing it logically and ensuring fast-loading pages. Technical SEO may not be as heavily emphasized as it used to be, but it’s still an important component of writing SEO content.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>5. Continually Update Content</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In addition to being helpful, identifying target keywords, including visual content, and ensuring a technically sound foundation, it’s important to continually update your content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Monitoring your website traffic analytics can help you make decisions on which posts to update. For example, if one of your blog posts is not generating traffic, try making adjustments. Change the headline, swap out images, or add a new call to action to the meta description. Break up longer sections of text with visuals or bulleted lists to make it easier to read. Rewrite the intro paragraph to make it more attention grabbing. Add a link to a related blog post that might be interesting to your audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">These tweaks may improve the effectiveness of your existing post, allowing you to increase traffic to your site without having to create new content from scratch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, marketers should update website pages and blog posts to reflect current information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For instance, if a trend highlighted in one of your blog posts becomes obsolete, that content needs to be updated so users are not presented with out-of-date information. Likewise, if one of your products begins offering a new feature, you should update the product page to showcase that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Updating your content can add value to existing posts and pages while giving users the most up-to-date and accurate information. That not only creates a better UX but also helps build your authority. Both of these are important SEO factors.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>SEO &amp; PPC Audits</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">There is one certainty with SEO and PPC; as algorithms continue to evolve there will always be something new to adjust to. As Google and other search engines begin to understand the context behind how prospects search on Google, the more SEO and PPC will continue to shift towards using intent-driven strategies to move the needle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The best way to understand the search landscape is to start with an audit, to see how your website is performing in search engine results and gain competitive intelligence in your online vertical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">SEO is still a long-term strategy, but it can result in a high ROI over time. As real-time rankings continue to increase in speed, higher authority domains can penetrate the top search results faster. This is why it’s so important to have an ongoing SEO growth strategy in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">PPC can be a short and long-term strategy based on your goals, but it works best when used for the long term for campaigns that prove out a positive ROI. PPC can offer fast levers to promote current products, services, and special offers that drive users to a dedicated landing page designed for engagement.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Why is SEO Important? These SEO Statistics Explain Why</b></span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The 1st 5 organic positions in Google account for 95% of all clicks, as of May 2021, according to data from </span><a href="https://www.advancedwebranking.com/ctrstudy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced Web Ranking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">.

This makes SEO an ongoing tactic, so content that is written in a format of how people naturally speak will help Google to better understand the context and intent, which places your website in a better position to rank for these new queries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The first organic result on a Google SERP has a 28.5% </span><a href="https://www.highervisibility.com/blog/how-to-improve-organic-click-through-rates-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">click-through rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">, according to the article posted b</span>y </span><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-first-page-clicks/374516/#close"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engine Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">.

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">1. Know Your Audience</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first step to writing effective Google ads is to know your audience. If your message isn’t directed at anyone in particular, it won’t resonate as well as focused, targeted ad copy will.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Keeping your audience in mind when writing ads is essential. Knowing the age, interests, and motivations of your customers allows you to speak to your target audience in a way that’s customized and meaningful to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For example, are they busy professionals who prefer quick, automated online experiences? Headlines like “Chat Available 24/7” or “Quick, Seamless Checkout” could be effective for this audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Maybe your audience consists of conscious consumers who want personalized, eco-friendly products. Ad copy such as “Hand-Crafted” or “Zero-Waste Packaging” may resonate more than “Overnight Shipping.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">By knowing your audience, you can write tailored ad copy that appeals to the users you want to engage. This strategy will not only help your brand connect to your target audience but also help you stand apart from your competitors.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">2. Demonstrate Value</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once you hone in on your audience, the next step is to demonstrate value through your Google Ads. </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Ad copy gives you the opportunity to communicate the value of your product or service at a glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">This can be a challenge, since character counts are limited. Google Ads allots 30 characters for headlines and 90 for descriptions. In order to maximize the limited space, it’s important to be intentional about your ad copy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To make the most of your Google Ads, focus on the value your product or service offers to the user. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">What problems does your product solve? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">What sets your brand apart from competitors? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">How can your product improve someone’s day-to-day experiences?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Why should a user click on your ad instead of the one next to it?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">What pain points does your service eliminate?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Illustrating the benefits of your product in a clear, concise way is key to writing compelling ad copy.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">3. Have a Strong Call to Action</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When writing Google Ads, it’s crucial to have a strong call to action. Your call to action sets expectations for what a user should do once they click your ad. This helps prompt them to engage and guides them to the next step of the customer journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Call to action examples include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;">Shop Now</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Learn More</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;">Call For More Information</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;">Sign Up to Get Exclusive Deals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;">Spend $40 &amp; Get Free Shipping</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;">Download for Free</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;">Order Now</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;">Schedule an Appointment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;">View Our Menu</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;">Visit Us Today</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Whether you’re writing search, display, or video ads, having a strong call to action is essential. Even something as simple as “Learn More” gives the user direction and encourages them to engage.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One advantage of using Google’s responsive ad formats is that you can try out multiple calls to action in the same ad. Google will automatically test different variations of the ad and determine which versions perform best.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As a result, you can see which call to action is most effective based on how often Google serves up that particular headline or description.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">4. Use Ad Extensions</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to knowing your audience, demonstrating value, and including a strong call to action, advertisers should utilize ad extensions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Because ad extensions aren’t technically part of the ad copy, they often get overlooked as part of the writing process. However, they present an opportunity to provide users with more information that may entice them to take a second look at your ad and click through to your website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Google Ads offers a variety of ad extensions, from sitelinks and structured snippets to <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/new-image-extensions-google-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image extensions</a>. Some, like call extensions or lead form extensions, offer additional engagement points.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Others, however, are text-based and provide more information about your product or service. For example, callout extensions provide a chance to showcase aspects of your business that you want to highlight, such as “Free Shipping,” “Locally Owned,” or “24/7 Support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, sitelink and price extensions have description fields where you can include brief but enticing copy. For instance, the description for a “Contact Us” sitelink could read, “Call Now to Speak with Our Friendly &amp; Experienced Team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">These ad extensions not only make your ad larger and more prominent on the SERP, but they offer additional ways to inform and connect with users. </span><span style="color: #000000;">For example, a callout extension could be the part of your ad that resonates with a certain user, and a structured snippet could be the difference between your ad getting ignored and getting clicked on.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">5. A/B Test</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The final key to writing effective ad copy in Google Ads is A/B testing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Testing helps take the guesswork out of writing ad copy. You can try out different messaging, and the data will show what’s most effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For example, say you’re trying to decide between a call to action of “Shop Now” and “Buy Now,” to see which produces a higher click through rate (CTR). You can run an A/B test to show some users ads with “Shop Now,” while other users will see “Buy Now.” Then, you can compare the results and see which version produced a higher CTR.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The data will reveal what works best. You can then apply those learnings to your current ads to improve performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Plus, the results can help inform your ad copy development in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This data-driven approach helps advertisers refine their ad messaging and make the most of the limited character counts in Google Ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Note that A/B testing shouldn’t be something you do just once. Instead, it should be an ongoing process in which you continually try out new verbiage, messaging, and calls to action.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">By using ad copy that’s proven itself to resonate with your audience and produce results, you can maximize your ad performance and your overall investment in Google Ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Unfamiliar with A/B testing? Luckily, Google Ads makes the process easy with campaign drafts and experiments.

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>1. ROAS</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">One of the biggest reasons why Google Ads is worthwhile for your business is the high return on ad spend, or ROAS. On average, businesses make $2 for every $1 they spend in Google Ads, a 200% ROAS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In order to achieve a positive ROAS in Google Ads, it’s important that your campaigns are set up correctly, structured well, and optimized over time. Optimization strategies such as negative keywords, ad scheduling, and smart bid strategies can ensure you’re reaching the right audience and maximizing your budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, by implementing an offline conversion upload strategy and feeding Google information about the value of your conversions, you can use machine learning to increase ROAS.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>2. Reach</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In addition to producing a high average ROAS, Google Ads reaches a massive number of people. Google dominates the search engine market, with <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-search-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubspot</a> estimating that over 5 billion searches happen on Google every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Reaching a large number of people means that Google Ads has the potential to find your target audience, and get your ads in front of them at the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Plus, the reach of Google Ads extends beyond just search. The Google Display Network (GDN) consists of millions of sites and apps across the internet, including Google-owned properties like Gmail. Display ads are eligible to show across the GDN, which reaches over 90% of internet users worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, Display, Video, and Discovery campaigns let advertisers harness the popularity of YouTube, which is the world’s second most visited website (after, of course, Google). The Pew Research Center says that 74% of American adults watch YouTube.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Additionally, certain campaign types let advertisers extend their reach through other Google properties like Google Play or Google Maps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">All of this is to say that Google Ads offers unparalleled access to consumers across the internet. That is part of what makes the platform so effective and worthwhile for businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">With Google Ads, there are countless ways to get your brand in front of your target audience.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>3. Innovation </b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Along with ROAS and reach, innovation helps make Google Ads worth it for advertisers. The platform is constantly updating and adding new features, such as <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/new-image-extensions-google-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image extensions</a> and advances in machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">New campaign formats like Discovery and Local campaigns require minimal input from advertisers, while taking advantage of Google’s wide array of properties, such as Maps, Gmail, and YouTube.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Meanwhile, innovative ad formats like <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/auto-generated-video-ads-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">auto-generated video ads</a> offer simple but creative ways for companies to promote their products and services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Technology evolves rapidly today, and so does consumer behavior. For example, Google states that 15% of searches every day are brand new queries that they’ve never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In response to the ever-changing digital world, Google is always adapting. This carries over to Google Ads, which continues to find new ways to connect advertisers with their audiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The innovative offerings on the platform help keep advertisers competitive and consumers engaged.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>4. Targeting Capabilities<br />
</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Google Ads offers a variety of ways to target ads to the right audience, from remarketing lists to <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/custom-audiences-google-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom audiences</a>. Getting ads in front of the right people at the right time helps make the platform a worthwhile investment for businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To get their ads in front of the right people, advertisers can target by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In-market audiences</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Affinity audiences</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Remarketing lists</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Custom audiences (formerly called custom intent)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Life events</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Customer Match</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Similar audiences</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Detailed demographics</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, to help users see your ads at the right time, ad scheduling lets you control when your ads are eligible to show. This can be useful for B2B companies, for example, as their target audience is most likely to engage during business hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">However, smart bid strategies help to automate some of these processes. For example, since Maximize Conversions uses signals to determine the right bid based on real-time data, you may not need to use ad scheduling with that bid strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Additionally, smart bidding helps make targeting by keyword easier. Google announced during this year&#8217;s <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/google-marketing-livestream-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Marketing Live</a> that the simplest keyword match type, broad match, has been overhauled to produce more relevant results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In fact, pairing broad match keywords with smart bid strategies and responsive search ads has been shown to increase conversions by 20%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Since Google Ads has so many targeting capabilities, it’s important to find what works best for your unique campaigns. <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/how-to-a-b-test-in-google-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A/B testing</a> different targeting methods and bid strategies can help optimize your performance and maximize your investment.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>5. Budget Control<br />
</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Finally, Google Ads is worth it because it gives advertisers complete control over their budgets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Based on the amount you want to spend per month, you set a daily budget for each campaign. Google will not spend more than your daily budget multiplied by the average number of days in a month, 30.4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, say you have a Google Ads budget of $1,000 per month. You would set your daily budget at $32.89 ($1,000 / 30.4). Some days, your campaign may spend $40.00 while other days it may spend $28.50. But your total spend for the month will not exceed $1,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Thus, although your daily spend may fluctuate in response to search demand and other factors, you have total control over your monthly budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Plus, you can change your budgets at any time. If certain campaigns aren’t working well, for instance, you can scale back spend or shift some of their budgets into higher-performing campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In addition to ROAS, reach, innovation, and targeting capabilities, budget control is yet another reason why Google Ads is worthwhile for businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">These 5 factors demonstrate that the PPC platform is an unparalleled tool for reaching your audience, communicating your message, and driving results.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Introduction to Google Marketing Livestream 2021</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Google Marketing Livestream kicked off with an introduction from Philipp Schindler, the Chief Business Officer at Google. He acknowledged the challenges of the past year, with COVID-19 forcing businesses to quickly adapt to a new reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">“We’re facing tougher challenges than ever,” Schindler said, “but it’s also possible to have a deeper impact than ever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">He then announced 3 areas marketers should focus on now, to prepare for the future:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Privacy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Measurement</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Automation </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The following segment, Building for the Future of Marketing, addresses these 3 areas. Intertwined are new product announcements, consumer behavior trends, specific recommendations for advertisers, and more.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Building for the Future of Marketing</b></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b>1. Privacy</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Vice President and GM of Google Ads, Jerry Dischler, took over from Schindler to speak more in-depth about the future of online privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">First, however, he recapped some of the new products and features Google released in 2020 and early 2021 to help businesses, such as the Insights page in Google Ads and the booking option for <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/local-services-ads-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local services ads</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">He then announced a new Google Ads campaign type called Performance Max. This campaign type will consolidate all of Google’s ad inventory, including Search, YouTube, Display, Discover, Gmail and Maps, giving advertisers expanded reach without having to manage multiple campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Performance Max campaigns are intended to help advertisers: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Find more converting customers due to the expanded formats</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Drive performance based on their goals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Deliver rich insights into the automation used </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The campaigns will be released in beta to thousands of advertisers starting today, with a full launch expected later this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Before segueing into privacy, Dischler addressed how COVID changed the way people searched and interacted with the digital world. For example, Google searches with the words “ideas for beginners” grew by over 100% during the pandemic. Meanwhile, searches containing “how to invest” increased by over 70%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">“As the world recovers,” he said, “we have more opportunities than ever to deliver what people are looking for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">However, as advertisers seek to connect with consumers in new and effective ways, privacy must be at the forefront.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Dischler noted that 81% of people said that the potential risks they face from data collection overshadow the benefits. This demonstrates users’ widespread concern about being tracked across the internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">“We all need to prioritize privacy with much greater urgency,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once third party cookies are phased out, Google asserts it will not build alternative identifiers to track individuals as they browse the internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Instead, advertisers should follow these 3 guidelines for transitioning to a world without cookies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Properly use consented, first-party data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Be forward-looking and predictive, using automation and machine learning that help you identify patterns and trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Commit to new technologies that preserve privacy, such as Google Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Note: The Privacy Sandbox is a new initiative centered around advances in privacy techniques, with a focus on keeping users anonymous. The goal is to help businesses and merchants connect with customers in a privacy-safe way.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;">2. Measurement</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The presentation then shifted from privacy to measurement, though the two topics greatly overlap. Vidhya Srinivasan, Google’s Vice President and GM of Ads Buying, Analytics, and Measurement, explained the current and future state of measurement in marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">“To make every marketing dollar count, you need to understand consumer behavior,” she said, but that also involves respecting user privacy. “Our industry is changing, and right now is the time to do the hard work of preserving the future of measurement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">According to Srinivasan, the future of measurement involves 3 key steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Build your measurement strategy on first-party data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Enable users to make choices about their data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Fill in gaps with modeled data</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Srinivasan touched on enhanced conversion measurement, a new way to measure conversions when cookies are not available. This will let your tags use consented, hashed first-party data like email addresses, from wherever your conversions are recorded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Additionally, Customer Match in Google Ads has become more widely available, with almost all advertisers now eligible to use it. Customer Match allows advertisers to deliver personalized yet privacy-safe ads using their company’s first-party data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To help fill in measurement gaps while still protecting user privacy, Google has introduced conversion modeling through Consent Mode. Furthermore, Google has added new consent capabilities to Google Tag Manager. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Later this year, Google Analytics will offer new features including modeled behavioral reporting, which can provide insights when cookies are not available. Plus, a new advertising snapshot will feature information such as cross-channel performance, attribution model comparisons, and campaign recommendations at a glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, Google Ads will be working on improved attribution reporting, with new touchpoints being added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Overall, this segment emphasized the importance of respecting user privacy choices and adopting modeling technology to fill in the gaps left by the absence of cookies.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b>3. Automation </b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The third area of emphasis during this segment was automation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Darshan Kantak, Vice President of Product Management for Search Ads and Google Ads Experiences, centered this topic around Google Ads and gave specific recommendations to advertisers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">“Automation drives results,” he said, “especially when you feed it the right information about the value of your ads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Kantak recommended using <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/what-are-responsive-search-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsive search ads</a> with broad match keywords and Smart Bidding. Advertisers who adopt this formula see an average of 20% more conversions at a similar CPA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Google is recommending this because broad match keywords have been overhauled to deliver more relevant searches. They now incorporate signals like landing pages, other keywords in your ad group, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Reinforcing the recommendation to pair broad match keywords with Smart Bidding, Kantak cited a case study where a toy company used this combination to increase revenue by 40% while maintaining a similar ROAS.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Additionally, Kantak revealed that image extensions are now out of beta and available to all advertisers. This exciting announcement means that all advertisers can now add engaging visuals to their search ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Another announcement involved the Insights page in Google Ads. This page currently offers information about changing query trends relevant to your business. Soon, Google will add demand forecasts to this page, which will predict changes to search behavior for the next 90 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Advertisers can use demand forecasts to prepare for upcoming shifts. For example, an advertiser may want to increase their campaign budget if the forecast shows an upcoming spike in demand. For e-commerce businesses, these predictions can also help with inventory decisions to prepare for lower or higher anticipated demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">As Kantak summed up this segment, he said, “Your marketing expertise combined with the power of Google’s machine learning can change the course of your business.”</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>The Future of Commerce </b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The next part of the Google Marketing Livestream keynote moved beyond the 3 focus areas for the future of marketing. This segment narrowed in on the future of commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Bill Ready, Google’s President of Commerce, Payments &amp; Next Billion Users, demonstrated how shopping habits are changing. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Curbside pickup searches grew 3,000% at the beginning of the pandemic</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In the fourth quarter of 2020, retail searches increased 3x over the previous year</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Searches for local businesses have grown over 80% YOY</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">70% of shoppers said they bought from a brand after seeing it on YouTube</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">71% of consumers prefer to buy from brands that align with their values</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Google has many plans in development to respond to these trends in consumer behavior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, Google highlighted its close partnership with Shopify. The President of Shopify, Harley Finkelstein, announced that Shop Pay will be available for anyone buying from Shopify merchants on Google. Finkelstein emphasized the seamlessness of Shop Pay, saying its conversion rate is almost twice as high as a typical checkout. That’s exciting news for e-commerce businesses on Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Meanwhile, in response to the dramatic increase in search demand for local businesses, Google announced local inventory ads. These ads will highlight products that are available for immediate in-store pickup, curbside pickup, or pickup at a later time. Furthermore, curbside pickup and in-store shopping labels are expanding to Maps and YouTube local ads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Later this year, Google will release a new “deals” results page on Search and Shopping. This page will specifically showcase deals, promotions, and discounts for products a user is searching for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Another consumer behavior trend has to do with brand identity. 71% of consumers say they prefer to buy from businesses that align with their values.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In response, Google will help businesses share information that communicates their brand identity and story. This started earlier this year with Black-owned business labels on Google My Business profiles. Google will add other label options to help identify companies owned and led by underrepresented communities, such as woman-owned businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Additionally, a pilot feature is coming soon that will showcase your company’s loyalty program benefits to shoppers directly on Google. This can engage existing, loyal customers while also enticing new customers to join your loyalty program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To help companies further communicate their brand identity, Google will test a “brand experience” feature. This will help businesses share their story and unique identity through videos and other content in addition to products and pricing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In an effort to connect businesses with a diverse audience, Google is implementing augmented reality (AR) capabilities. AR developments include a makeup kit where users can see what foundation and other beauty products look like on a range of skin tones. Users can even virtually try it on themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To help businesses stay competitive and informed, Google will launch a competitive visibility report in the Merchant Center. This report will give more insights into how your performance stacks up to competitors. This feature will also provide suggested actions, such as adjusting pricing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Finally, marketers and advertisers know that when shopping, many consumers add products to their carts without completing the transaction. Soon, when users open a new tab, Google Chrome will show them all their open carts in one place, along with any discounts the retailer is offering. This may encourage customers to re-engage and complete the transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In summary, Google’s commerce division is focused on 4 things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Building an open ecosystem where businesses of all sizes can grow</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Helping businesses reach shoppers across the customer journey</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Building experiences to help companies tell their brand story</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Delivering consumer insights to guide action</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Marketing in the Age of Automation</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">While Darshan Kantak spoke on automation earlier in the keynote, Google’s Vice President of Global Business Solutions, Jason Spero, added to the conversation and provided additional insights for marketers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, he revealed that Google Ads is trying to minimize the 2-week learning period that follows the implementation of, or change to, an automated bid strategy. Furthermore, he promised more transparency into the automation processes used by Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Mostly, however, Spero focused on 3 automation trends he’s seeing from businesses:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Responding in real-time to shifts in demand</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Optimizing across channels like search, display, and video</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Engaging with automation actively to improve performance</span></li>
</ol>

<div class="row"  id="row-764045641">

	<div id="col-177836351" class="col small-12 large-12"  >
				<div class="col-inner"  >
			
			
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b>1. Real-Time Responses to Shifts in Demand</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Spero stated that 15% of search queries every day are brand new. This means that the way consumers search, and what they search for, is constantly evolving. How can marketers possibly keep up?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">According to Google, the answer is automation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, broad match keywords now use machine learning to understand how words and phrases are semantically related. This allows advertisers to capitalize on the different and novel ways consumers are searching for products related to their business, without having to do constant keyword research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Reiterating the recommendation from earlier, Spero encouraged advertisers to pair broad match keywords with Smart Bidding in Google Ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To show the benefits of pairing broad match with Smart Bidding, he used a case study of a company that sells dog food. Their advertising team was hesitant to switch from broad match modified to broad match keywords. So, they used <a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/how-to-a-b-test-in-google-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A/B testing in Google Ads</a> to experiment with broad match keywords. They also implemented tactics like responsive and dynamic search ads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">As a result, conversions from their search campaigns increased 182%.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b>2. Optimizing Across Channels</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The second trend related to automation is that more and more businesses are optimizing across different channels. This is imperative given the complex customer journey of today’s consumer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For instance, the consumer journey may start with a Google search, but often also involves watching videos, reading reviews, visiting Google Maps, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">It’s critical to build a holistic market strategy that involves multiple digital channels. Whether your goal is revenue growth or acquiring new customers, your strategy needs to understand and match the needs of your consumer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">“Marketing only delivers its full potential when you understand and optimize to these real business outcomes,” said Spero.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b>3. Engaging with Automation</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The third and final trend in this segment is active engagement with automation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Advertisers are abandoning the set-it-and-forget-it mindset when it comes to automation. By actively feeding Google the data it needs to capitalize on machine learning, advertisers are using automation to improve performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">“Automation is changing your jobs,&#8221; Spero acknowledged, &#8220;but it will also give you leverage by freeing your teams to create new and more thoughtful value.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In other words, automation is replacing some of the tasks traditionally involved in account management, such as manual bidding and keyword management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">However, this frees advertisers up to develop and implement more sophisticated tactics, such as offline conversion uploads, value-based bidding, and first-party data strategies like Customer Match.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Case Studies and Real-World Examples</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In the final part of the keynote, Google showcased case studies and real-world examples of businesses adapting to current trends and preparing for the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Business leaders like Jim Farley, President and CEO of the Ford Motor Company, and Kory Marchisotto, CMO of e.l.f. Beauty and President of Keys Soulcare, detailed tactics their companies have used to transform for the future and drive innovation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">This conversation features Alicia Keys, who discussed the development of Keys Soulcare, a clean skincare and wellness brand she created in partnership with e.l.f.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The Google Marketing Livestream keynote concluded with Emmanuel Acho. The former NFL player described how he’s been able to leverage YouTube to “amplify true, genuine content” and have authentic conversations about race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">He emphasized the importance of businesses being intentional with their words and actions in today&#8217;s world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">“If we navigate business without intentions, then we will navigate a meaningless business,” Acho said. “It’s easy to be successful. It is hard to be significant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Learning how to A/B test in Google Ads may seem daunting, especially if you’re setting one up for the first time. Luckily, the platform makes A/B testing easy with campaign experiments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Campaign experiments allow you to split test virtually any variable, from bid strategies to landing pages, all while keeping the same budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Below, we’ll walk you through exactly how to A/B test in Google Ads using campaign experiments.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">What is a Campaign Experiment?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Campaign experiments in Google Ads allow you to easily A/B test variables such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ad copy</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Bid strategies</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Landing pages</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ad extensions</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Display URLs</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Keywords &amp; negative keywords</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ad scheduling</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Targeting settings</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Bid adjustments</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Essentially, campaign experiments let you create a copy of an existing campaign and make your desired changes. For example, if you want to test a different landing page, you would change the final URLs in the campaign experiment to the new landing page.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile, the original campaign remains unchanged. As a result, the original campaign becomes the “control,” while the new campaign is the “experiment” where the variable is being tested.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once launched, the campaign experiment and original campaign run simultaneously. This lets you monitor performance in real-time and compare the performance of the campaign experiment versus the control.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Note that campaign experiments are currently available for Search and Display campaigns only.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Benefits of Using Campaign Experiments</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A/B testing with campaign experiments offers unique advantages. For instance, the campaign experiment shares a budget with the original campaign. This is beneficial because you don’t have to increase your overall spend or secure extra money in order to run your A/B test. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Plus, you have control over how to split the budget. It can be an even 50/50 split, or a different allocation such as 70/30.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to the shared budget, you are able to run the experiment and control at the same, which limits the impact of outside variables on your results, such as seasonality. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, Google indicates when certain metrics in your campaign experiment have reached statistical significance. This can help you analyze the results and decide when to end the experiment.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/the-state-of-ab-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invesp</a></span>, 58% of companies perform A/B tests on paid search campaigns. When added to your PPC strategy, A/B testing can help you gain insights and make informed changes to improve the performance your campaigns.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Preparing for Your A/B Test</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Before you start setting up a campaign experiment in Google Ads, ensure you are prepared for your A/B test by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Recording your hypothesis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Determining your variable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Identifying your KPIs</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">These are crucial preliminary steps. By recording your hypothesis, you document your expectations of how the variable will impact performance. This can be helpful to refer back to once the test has been completed, so you can see how the actual results measure up to your prediction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Meanwhile, you need to clearly define your variable. “Variable” refers to the change you will be making in the campaign experiment, such as a new bid strategy or a different landing page. The variable is what differentiates the A/B test from the original campaign, and it dictates what the campaign experiment will be testing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Finally, before launching the A/B test, you must identify your KPIs. KPIs, or key performance indicators, are the metrics or values you will use to measure success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, if you’re testing a new landing page to see if it will increase conversions like sign ups or contact form submissions, then conversions would be your main KPI. If you’re testing new ad copy to see if it will increase ad engagement, then clickthrough rate (CTR) would likely be your KPI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Your KPIs will guide your analysis of the A/B test, and allow you to evaluate whether the campaign experiment outperformed the original, or vice versa.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b><img class="alignnone wp-image-5997" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Pencil-1d.png" alt="pencil icon" width="45" height="45" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Pencil-1d.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Pencil-1d-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 45px) 100vw, 45px" />  1. Create a Draft Campaign</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Before you can launch a campaign experiment, you need to create a draft. This is essentially a copy of the original campaign, where you’ll change the variable that you want to test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To create a draft, go into your Google Ads account and click on the Drafts &amp; Experiments dropdown on the left hand menu. Select the first option, Campaign drafts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once you’re on the Campaign drafts page:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Click the blue plus button</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Select the campaign in which you want to run your A/B test</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Name your draft. For example, “XYZ Campaign &#8211; Bid Strategy A/B Test”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Add a description of the test you’re running (this is optional)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Click Save</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">It will then take you into the draft campaign, where you’ll make your variable change. </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Be sure to change only the variable you’re testing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Note that if you use URL tracking templates that don’t automatically populate the campaign name, be sure to update the draft campaign name in the tracking template settings so it’s identifiable in your CRM as a test campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once you’ve made the necessary changes to your draft campaign, click Drafts &amp; Experiments on the left hand menu. You’ve successfully set up your draft, and the next step is to create the campaign experiment.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b><img class="alignnone wp-image-5999" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/10-2.png" alt="Test tube icons" width="50" height="50" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/10-2.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/10-2-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 50px) 100vw, 50px" />  2. Set Up the Experiment</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In the Campaign Experiments view, click the blue plus button. Then, give your test campaign a name. It can be the same name as the draft, such as “XYZ Campaign &#8211; Bid Strategy A/B Test.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">You can add an optional description of the campaign experiment, if you prefer. Then, select the start date for the A/B test. If you have a set timeframe in which the campaign experiment will run, you can go ahead and select an end date. If you want it to run indefinitely, however, select None. With this option, the experiment will run until you manually end it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Next, under Experiment Split, enter the percentage of your campaign’s budget that will be allocated to your experiment. For example, if you want your campaign experiment to have an equal chance of showing up in the auction as your original campaign, you can leave this setting as the default of 50%. If you only want your experiment campaign to receive a fraction of the budget and, as a result, show less frequently than the original campaign, you can set it along the lines of 20% or 30%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For the purposes of A/B testing and analysis, many advertisers find that a 50/50 split is easiest, since it removes budget as a differentiating variable between the two campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The last step is under Advanced Options. You can choose from one of two settings: search-based or cookie-based. The main difference is that with search-based split, a certain user could see ads from both your original campaign and the experiment campaign. With cookie-based, a user will see either the original or the experiment, but not both. No matter how many times they search, they will only see one version of your A/B test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once you’ve chosen your settings, you’re ready to begin the experiment. Click Save, and the new campaign experiment will be created.</span></p>

Monitor Performance</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Congratulations! You’ve set up an A/B test using campaign experiments. Now that the test is created, you can monitor its performance as it begins to serve and collect data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The campaign experiment will appear in your Google Ads campaign dashboard, alongside your other campaigns. Experiments are easily identifiable by the green triangle symbol next to the campaign name, standing out from the green circles next to regular enabled campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">It’s important to make sure the ads and extensions get approved in your campaign experiment. Like with any new campaign, the ads and extensions in your experiment have to go through Google’s approval process. Usually, this doesn’t take long, but sometimes approval or policy issues arise. Therefore, it’s important to check that everything gets approved. Otherwise, your results could be impacted by an unintended variable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once the ads are approved and the campaign begins serving, you can monitor the results either directly in Google Ads or by creating a dashboard in a platform like <a href="https://support.google.com/datastudio/answer/6283323?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Google Data Studio</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Dashboards with visualizations can help you more easily understand the data and the performance of your A/B test. They can be customized to show your KPIs, so you can see at a glance which campaign is performing better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">How long should you keep your experiment running? You may have a set time frame in mind (i.e. 60 days), but the best practice would be to leave it running until your KPIs reach statistical significance. In Google Ads, a blue star will appear next to the metrics that have reached statistical significance, which you can see when you click into the campaign experiment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once you’re ready to end your A/B test, you need to analyze the data.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">You may have a set time frame in mind (i.e. 60 days), but the best practice would be to leave the campaign experiment running until your KPIs reach statistical significance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In Google Ads, a blue star will appear next to the metrics that have reached statistical significance. You can see this when you click into the campaign experiment.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Analyzing A/B Test Results</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once your A/B test concludes, it&#8217;s time to analyze the results. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Analyzing data from your A/B test lets you determine which campaign was the &#8220;winner,&#8221; and whether or not those results aligned with your hypothesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Your analysis can be done right in Google Ads, but it&#8217;s often easier to use a reporting platform that allows you to build visualizations. Graphs and charts can not only help you understand the data, but they also make it easier to communicate the results and their significance to other stakeholders, such as team members or higher-ups.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For your analysis, you should focus on the KPIs you identified back before the test began. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In the visualization examples below, you can easily compare the performance of the two campaigns. As you can see, if your main KPI was CTR or conversions, the experiment campaign would be the clear winner. However, if lead quality was your KPI, the original campaign would be the winner.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Applying Your Learnings</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For your A/B test, if the experiment campaign is the winner, you can apply the changed variable to your original campaign. Simply click into the experiment and hit Apply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">This will alter your original campaign to match the changes you made in the campaign experiment. For example, if you were testing a new bid strategy, clicking Apply would change the original campaign’s bid strategy to the one you were testing in the campaign experiment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Otherwise, if your original campaign was the winner, click into the campaign experiment and hit End Now. The test will end, and your original campaign will remain untouched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Even if your campaign experiment didn’t end up outperforming the original campaign, the A/B test was still successful because it provided learnings. A/B testing should be an ongoing process that helps advertisers gather insights about audiences, messaging, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Plus, Google Ads is always adding new features and products, so there is no shortage of variables available to test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">If you need help developing an A/B testing plan or assistance with your overall Google Ads strategy, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/request-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">request a proposal</a></span> from Creative Website Marketing today.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b style="color: #000000;">1. Services and Expertise</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Online marketing encompasses a broad range of service areas. Some agencies are full-service, meaning they provide everything from social media management to email marketing. Other agencies focus on specific service areas, such as <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/what-do-ppc-management-companies-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC Management</a></span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Thus, when choosing a digital marketing agency, it’s important to understand which services the agency provides. Do their service offerings align with your goals?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, if you want to increase organic traffic and keyword rankings, an agency that specializes in SEO services would probably be a better fit than a company whose primary focus is email marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, ensure that the agency not only provides the service you’re looking for, but demonstrates expertise in that area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">An agency may offer a variety of services, but which ones are their bread and butter? What do they truly specialize in? This is important because you want to be sure you’re hiring a team of experts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For instance, an agency that specializes in one service may be a better fit than a full-service option if they have the knowledge it takes to bring innovative strategies to the table and make your company competitive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Likewise, if an agency’s areas of expertise don’t line up with the services you need, it might not be the right fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To determine a digital marketing company’s level of expertise, you can look for certain qualifications such as being Google Ads certified, a Facebook marketing partner, or a HubSpot certified partner. These are by no means a requirement. However, they can help increase your confidence that an agency has the expertise you’re looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To further assess an agency’s level of expertise, note how comfortable they are discussing their services. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Are they able to answer your questions? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Can they explain technical concepts in a simplified, easy to understand way? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Have they encountered your pain points before? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Do they make the connection between their services and your business goals?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Prioritize agencies that demonstrate a thorough understanding of the services you need. By doing so, you will be better positioned to choose a digital marketing agency that can deliver results and help you meet your business goals.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>2. Knowledge of Your Business</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In addition to specializing in the services you need, digital marketing agencies need to understand your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Industry experience is a plus. Having worked with other businesses in your field, the agency will be familiar with the unique challenges and landscape of your industry. They may also be able to apply strategies to your business that have worked for others in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">However, every company is different– even ones in the same industry. Tactics that worked for one of your competitors may not necessarily be right for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Therefore, even more important than industry experience is an agency’s willingness to get to know your specific business. They should ask questions about your goals, your brand, your target audience, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">All of this develops into a picture of what success looks like for your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Why is this important? Ideally, you don’t want a cookie cutter approach. Instead, you want a custom strategy tailored to your company. Your unique needs and KPIs should inform the agency’s approach from the very beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">That way, your digital marketing efforts sync up with your business goals. Your strategy, your messaging, and your objectives are aligned. As a result, you’re more likely to achieve the outcomes you desire.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>3. Good Communication</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Another consideration when choosing a digital marketing agency is communication. As with any working relationship, communication is key. If you want to launch a new initiative quickly or if a time-sensitive issue arises, you’re going to want an agency partner that’s responsive and ready to work with you to find a solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To evaluate the communication style of a marketing agency, take note of how easy it is to get in touch with them. Is it a chore? Does it take multiple emails to get a response?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">It’s a bit too much to ask for an immediate reply every time you reach out. However, if you have to send three emails and leave a voicemail before they get back to you, that’s not a good sign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In addition to response time, pay attention to their approach to customer service. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Are they willing to answer questions?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Do team members demonstrate flexibility?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Is this a group of people you would enjoy working with?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, an agency should be able to communicate their services in a way you can understand. Digital marketing is a complicated industry with a lot of jargon and specializations. It’s important to find an agency who can explain complex terms and concepts in an understandable manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">That way, you are informed about the marketing tactics the agency uses. Perhaps more importantly, you’ll understand how those tactics help accomplish your business goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Without good communication, a disconnect can occur between your business and the online marketing agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, the agency may end up implementing tactics that don’t serve your business goals. If they are unresponsive and lack good customer service, you may have a difficult time remedying this problem. Or, if they haven’t clearly communicated the services they’re providing, you may not even know the marketing efforts aren’t aligned with your goals. Meanwhile, you’re paying for services that don’t benefit your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Therefore, communication is a crucial consideration when choosing a digital marketing agency.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>4. Reviews and Testimonials</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">When wondering how to choose a digital marketing agency, reviews and testimonials are helpful tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Today&#8217;s consumers have come to rely on reviews as part of their purchasing process. In fact, according to the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/online-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spiegel Research Center</a></span>, around 95% of customers read reviews before making a purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although researching marketing agencies is different than shopping for a new coffee maker or pair of running shoes, reviews can still be useful in helping you evaluate your various options.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Google My Business is often a great place to start. These reviews are easy to find and can give insight into the experience of working with a certain agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The number of reviews for each agency will depend on their size, how long they’ve been in business, and other factors. However, the content of the reviews holds the most value. Are they generally positive? Are customers satisfied? What details are included that might help set an agency apart?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In addition to Google reviews, many digital marketing companies will feature testimonials on their website. While these quotes are typically hand-picked to show an agency in the best light, it can still be helpful to browse testimonials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, case studies can be helpful sources of information. As opposed to most testimonials, case studies provide data to show that the agency has produced measurable results for their clients. This can be especially useful if the case study relates to your industry, company size, or market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Trust signals like reviews and testimonials can be a great way to sort through different agencies and get a sense of what their customers have to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Keep in mind, however, that a five-star rating doesn’t automatically mean an agency is the best fit for your business. Thus, it’s important not to rely solely on reviews and incorporate other factors into your decision.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>5. Realistic Expectations</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">When you are deciding which digital marketing agency to hire, be aware of the expectations they are setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">A top-notch agency will set clear expectations with you. They will be transparent about things like pricing, scope of services, timeframe, and deliverables.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, they should be straightforward about the results you can expect from their services. </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be wary of agencies that overpromise or guarantee results that sound too good to be true. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if an agency says they can double your organic traffic overnight or dramatically increase email subscribers right off the bat, that’s a red flag.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Having an agency guarantee amazing results may sound enticing at first. However, promises of rapid, extreme growth can indicate deceptive and unethical practices– or plain dishonesty. When you’re looking for a strong, viable, and long-term agency partnership, those are qualities you want to steer clear of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Not only are shady marketing techniques unethical, they’re often ineffective and unsustainable. Google and other search engines are aware of these techniques and have grown sophisticated enough to recognize them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In fact, Google will penalize websites for things like keyword stuffing, cloaking, and other “black hat” marketing tactics. Once your website has been flagged for such practices, it can be difficult to recover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Data and privacy is another consideration. This is a huge focus area right now, and abusing user data or violating privacy policies in online marketing is very serious. For this reason alone, you do not want to get involved with an agency engaged in unethical, deceptive, or manipulative practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Instead, you want a trustworthy agency acting on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Look for agencies who are honest about what they provide and the results you can expect. Digital marketing isn’t an overnight fix in most cases, especially in areas like SEO and content marketing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">That’s not to say that agencies can never produce quick results. Just be aware that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In the long run, it’s better to work with an agency that provides legitimate, lasting services that set you up for long-term success.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">What Does a PPC Management Company Do?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">PPC management companies oversee the online paid advertising efforts of their clients. For those unfamiliar with the term, PPC stands for pay-per-click and encompasses a broad range of digital ad formats, from the search ads you see at the top of Google to video ads you see on YouTube.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s a PPC company’s job to manage online ad campaigns for different clients, making sure the right ads show to the right people at the right time, within a given budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, by implementing conversion tracking to attribute phone and web leads to your PPC campaigns, and analyzing data relevant to your goals, PPC management companies can prove marketing ROI.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Every PPC company will approach account management differently. For example, some agencies may specialize in one platform like Google Ads or Facebook, while others manage ads in multiple platforms. Some companies may be more hands-on with account management, while others rely more on a platform’s machine learning to take the lead on changes and optimizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the end, a company’s approach depends on their capabilities and resources, plus the needs of the businesses they serve. Nevertheless, while approaches can vary, all PPC companies provide the same overall service of managing online paid advertising campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Below, take a closer look at the responsibilities of a PPC management company, which fall into three overarching categories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Setup</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Reporting</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Optimization</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Setup</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first responsibility of any PPC management company is to set up the campaign and lay the foundation for success. This involves several steps such as devising a <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/the-understated-value-of-adwords-campaign-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign structure</a></span>, creating ads and implementing conversion tracking. However, it starts with strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Developing a strong strategy is essential for running an effective ad campaign, and it’s one of the first things a PPC management agency should do.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To form an effective strategy, the PPC agency will need to gain an understanding of their client’s business objectives and marketing goals. What’s the purpose of the paid advertising campaign? Does the client want to drive more phone calls? Get more newsletter sign-ups? Increase online purchases? Grow brand awareness?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Additionally, this process involves getting to know the target audience and any customer personas the client may have outlined. Furthermore, agencies will need to identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that can help measure success, such as impression share, click-through rate (CTR), conversions, lead quality or revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">All of this information helps create a comprehensive strategy. Once the strategy is in place, it will inform the remainder of the campaign setup, from campaign type and location targeting to conversion tracking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Campaign setup involves a variety of factors, many of which vary by platform and campaign type. Tasks may include setting up:</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Location targeting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Audience and demographic targeting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Placements or topics </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Content exclusions</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once a PPC company has set up and launched the campaign, the next step is to build out appropriate reporting to monitor performance and guide optimization.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Reporting</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to setting up campaigns, one of the most important things a PPC management company does is reporting. Reports should be customized to the client’s KPIs and delivered on a regular basis, such as bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Different PPC agencies use different platforms for reporting. Some may use Excel, for example, while others may use Google Data Studio. Some companies may provide static reports, while others offer dynamic reporting dashboards where the data updates in real time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Regardless of the platform they use, PPC companies should ensure reports contain information relevant to their clients’ goals. Most reports will incorporate graphs and charts to help convey complex data in a visual and easy-to-understand manner. Many will also include benchmarks and comparisons to help put the data into context.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The level of sophistication in reporting can vary based on an agency’s resources and expertise, as well as the client’s needs. Some clients may only want to see ad-level metrics like clicks and impressions. Others may want a deeper analysis into website engagement, lead quality and ROI.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some PPC management companies will bring in data from multiple sources to give their clients a more comprehensive picture. For example, a client may have a campaign running on Instagram, but reporting data from Google Analytics can help the client better understand the other channels through which users are coming to their website, and how they’re engaging once they’re there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This information can be a value-add and give businesses a more holistic view of their online presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the end, reports not only keep the client informed of campaign performance but also allow the PPC agency to analyze data and gain insights. This leads to data-driven decisions and tactics that can help optimize the campaign.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Optimization</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The third main area of responsibility for PPC management companies is optimization. This is an ongoing process of managing and tweaking the campaign to improve efficiencies and performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The optimization decisions a PPC company makes should derive from data and serve the goals of their clients. A client focused on lead quality, for example, will require very different tactics than a client whose goal is to grow brand awareness.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">PPC optimization tactics include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A/B testing</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Bid strategy changes</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Budget shifts</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ad scheduling</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Targeting adjustments</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Negative keywords</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Audience observations</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Beta features like <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/new-image-extensions-google-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image extensions</a></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Bid adjustments</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to the above, PPC companies need to keep up with platform changes like new ad products and policy updates. This is a crucial part of keeping a campaign optimized and avoiding costly missteps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For example, Google Ads recently removed age, zip code and other targeting capabilities for advertisers in a handful of verticals. If a PPC agency was unaware of this change or failed to address it, an affected client’s ads could have stopped serving due to policy noncompliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For this and many other reasons, businesses that are interested in obtaining PPC management services should be sure the agency they choose is attentive, proactive, and knowledgeable.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>What are Local Services Ads on Google?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Google’s Local Services Ads showcase local businesses and service providers at the top of the search results page. Local Services Ads grab users&#8217; attention with images, reviews, business hours, and more in a concise and easy-to-read format.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">By allowing users to easily see, compare, and contact service providers in their area, Local Services Ads offer businesses a chance to grow brand awareness and win new customers.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">How Do Local Services Ads Work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Local Services Ads show up based on a variety of factors, including the context of the user’s search, the review score of the business, the quantity of reviews the business has, the proximity of the company to the user, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Users who click an ad are taken to the company&#8217;s Local Services profile, where they have the opportunity to reach out via phone or messaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other ad formats in which you pay per click, Local Services Ads are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay-per-lead</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means that if you advertise with Local Services Ads, you’ll only pay when a potential customer contacts you. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, you can set a “monthly max,” which ensures you won’t spend more than your set budget.</span></span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>What are the Green Check Marks?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The green check mark in a Local Services Ad represents one of two certifications from Google: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Google Guarantee</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Google Screened</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a company signs up for Local Services Ads and completes a screening and qualification process, they receive the </span><b>Google Guarantee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> badge. The Google Guarantee offers a reimbursement for customers if they are dissatisfied with the service they receive. The reimbursement would come directly from Google, covering a customer’s costs up to a certain point (the lifetime limit in the U.S. is $2,000).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Thus, the Google Guarantee badge offers a trust signal to consumers and provides an incentive for them to choose your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses may also be eligible for a </span><b>Google Screened</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> badge. Available only to select verticals such as Law, Financial Planning, and Real Estate, businesses can earn this badge by completing extensive background and license checks from Google. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Similar to the Google Guarantee badge, the Google Screened badge acts as a trust signal to consumers, ensuring them that the business they see in the Local Services Ad is legitimate. This can increase a company&#8217;s chance of winning the click and earning new business.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Where Do the Reviews Come From?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The reviews that appear in your Local Services Ad come from your Google My Business profile. However, you can also collect reviews directly through the Local Services platform. If the review comes from a user who found you and booked your services through Google, it will show a &#8220;Google verified&#8221; label next to the review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Local Services Ads will show an average star rating, with the opportunity for users to read specific reviews once they click to view your profile. Users may also click a “See reviews” link in the ad, which takes them directly to the reviews section of your profile.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Benefits of Local Services Ads</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">There are several advantages to Local Services Ads, such as prominently displayed trust signals. Positive reviews and the Google badges instantly establish credibility with consumers and give them confidence in your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Additionally, Local Service Ads show up at the top of the SERP. Because they are the first thing users see, they can immediately influence a customer’s buying journey. Since they show up to users in close proximity to your business, they’re ideal for local companies who want to get in front of the right people at the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The information displayed is relevant, easy to read, and helpful to the user. In a way, these ads serve almost as mini-Google My Business profiles. However, they’re more concise and focused on the goal of driving leads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Plus, the ads are attention-grabbing due to visual aspects like photos, reviews, and the Google badges. Combined with a position at the very top of the page, this is a huge advantage given how varied and competitive the SERP landscape has become.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Furthermore, the pay-per-lead cost model can be a good fit for many companies, especially when the business objective is to drive leads instead of, for example, website traffic. With this model, it’s easy to understand (and communicate to superiors) what the business is getting for its advertising investment.</span></p>
