<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In any PPC campaign, marketers must always consider what happens once they win the click. That&#8217;s why landing pages, the web page users are taken to once they click on an ad, are a critical part of PPC strategy. However, many marketers struggle to create landing pages that convert.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing pages are the culmination of efforts to get your ad to show up and users to click. But in order to generate engagement, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">landing pages must be crafted to fit the intent of your target audience and tailored to produce conversions.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">These 4 key tactics can help PPC marketers create landing pages that convert.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>1. Incorporate Visual Content</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first key to creating landing pages that convert involves visual content. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all heard the phrase “content is king.” That may be true, but not all content is effective at engaging users. Truthfully, most people will lose interest reading through 800 words of straight text, no matter how well-written or informative it may be.</span></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1069 size-full" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Gladiator.gif" alt="Are You Not Entertained? gif" width="500" height="213" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Today’s users crave a variety of entertaining and high-quality visual content. This means that high-performing landing pages will utilize videos, quizzes, infographics, and other forms of engaging and interactive media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">If your landing page is predominantly informational, text should be organized into short paragraphs with frequent subheadings– but that’s still not enough to really keep the attention of your audience. To engage users and further break up the monotony of text, support your written content with: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Images</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Infographics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Gifs</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Statistics </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Charts &amp; Graphs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Animations &amp; Videos</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data supports the importance of visual content. According to </span><span style="color: #0763a8;"><a style="color: #0763a8;" href="https://www.wmgagency.co.uk/why-every-seo-strategy-needs-infographics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WMG</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #0763a8;">,</span> 60% of people are visual learners, and 40% of people respond better to visual information than only text. Thus, businesses can enhance the user experience (UX) by incorporating visual content into their landing pages.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">With a better UX, users are more likely to stay on the page and interact with your site. This can lead to engagement and increase the likelihood a user will convert.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1067" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/3-5-1024x536.png" alt="Use Video To Increase Conversions" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/3-5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/3-5-300x157.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/3-5-768x402.png 768w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/3-5.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>2. Have a Clear Call to Action</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">A landing page without a clear call to action can bring the customer journey to a grinding halt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">You want to make it as easy as possible for the user to engage with your site and take the next step toward becoming a customer. This means featuring your call to action (CTA) in a prominent location, and making it stand out. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, a user can find it without having to search the menu bar, scroll past paragraphs of text, or navigate to a different page. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps you guide the user seamlessly toward conversion.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Common CTAs include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Sign Up For Our Newsletter</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Make An Appointment</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Call Us</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Join Our Email List</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Download Your Free Ebook </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Contact Us</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Buy Now</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Whether it’s a button, phone number, or form, your CTA needs to stand out. Make sure the font is large enough and easy to read. Differentiate the CTA from the rest of your content by, for example, making the button a bright color that pops off the page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">If you’re asking for any user information (email, phone number, zip code, etc.), clearly state what you need the information for and what the user will get once they provide it. This helps the user feel comfortable about providing personal information, increasing their chances of actually completing the conversion.</span></p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1070" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2-3-1024x536.png" alt="Landing Page Tip" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2-3-1024x536.png 1024w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2-3-300x157.png 300w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2-3-768x402.png 768w, https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2-3.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><b></b></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>3. Make It Relevant to Your Ads</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">When crafting a PPC landing page, ensure it&#8217;s relevant to your ad. There’s no point in driving users to a page that doesn’t have the information they’re expecting to find. In fact, an irrelevant landing page will cause bounce rates to skyrocket and ad rank to drop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">For example, if an ad for athletic sneakers takes users to a page selling dress pants, chances are most people will promptly leave the page and return to the SERP. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1075 size-full" src="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/Parks-Rec.gif" alt="Parks and Rec gif" width="347" height="200" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Thus, an irrelevant landing page can result in your business:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Losing out on customer engagement</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Spending money on clicks that don&#8217;t convert</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Signaling a poor landing page experience to Google</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">To ensure that doesn’t happen, the landing page must align with ad messaging and user intent. Think about the language and keywords present in your ads, and make sure they’re included in the content on your landing page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">In addition to helping your Quality Score, a relevant landing page provides your audience with the information they are searching for and showcases how your brand can meet their needs. Providing a user with the information they need in their moment of intent is a proven strategy for driving conversions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>4. A/B Test</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">The final tactic for creating landing pages that convert is A/B testing. Discover the best possible version of your landing page by conducting A/B tests that experiment with different layouts, calls to action, form lengths, content types, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Sometimes called split testing, A/B testing allows advertisers to direct users to different versions of a landing page and measure which one performs best.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you’re not sure whether your call to action button should say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscribe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can conduct an A/B test to see which version produces more conversions. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Once the data clarifies which version performs better, drive 100% of users there and watch your conversions grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">A/B testing should not be something you do just once. Instead, it should be an ongoing tactic as you gather learnings and think of new variables to test.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A recent survey by </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Clutch</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> explored the different ways B2B audiences discover the content of other businesses. According to the survey, the most common way B2B audiences encounter business content is by </span><b>search</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, </span><b>87%</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> of B2B audiences utilize search engines to find their information, surpassing social media at 85%. Businesses can utilize the following strategies to capitalize on the popularity of search in order to reach B2B audiences.</span></p>
<h2><b>Consider Intent</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">B2B audiences primarily consume content to:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">a.) Stay on top of industry trends</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">b.) Research companies to determine whether or not they want to make a purchase </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Audiences interested in industry trends often turn to blogs and articles, as they provide more in-depth information than, say, an image on social media. Meanwhile, those with purchasing intent prefer reviews and product descriptions to help inform them on their buying journey. </span></p>
<h2><b>Produce A Variety Of Content</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To engage audiences with different intentions, businesses should produce a variety of content. Start by creating a blog, and post articles about industry trends, news, and developments. Establish your business as up-to-date and a thought leader in the industry. Perhaps include an infographic for a visual aid, and share the graphic on social media to promote the article. These blog posts can help build your credibility and cultivate trust with B2B audiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because businesses may also be using search engines to research your company, focus on getting Google My Business reviews. Discover tips for gaining 5-star reviews </span><a href="https://creativewebsitemarketing.com/2017/09/05/how-to-get-google-my-business-reviews-fast-supercharge-your-5-star-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, devote space on your website to describing your products or services. In addition to helping your search rankings, informative and relevant descriptions can draw in B2B audiences and keep them on your site for longer periods of time. If B2B audiences are visiting your website, they may be assessing your company with the intent to purchase; therefore, your site should explain what you have to offer in a clear, accurate, and engaging manner. </span></p>
<h2><b>Optimize!</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To reach B2B audiences through search, companies should invest in SEO as well as paid search campaigns. However, websites and content must be optimized not just for search engines but also for the audience. Ensure content is readable and appealing. When crafting your website and social media pages, anticipate what your target audience needs and the questions they may be asking. These questions may differ based on who is searching; thus, generating content to satisfy different personas within target audiences is a helpful strategy for B2B marketing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By recognizing the prevalence of B2B audiences using search in 2018, companies can gain a competitive edge. Understanding your audience and focusing on content are key factors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What other tips do you have for reaching B2B audiences through search?</span></p>
