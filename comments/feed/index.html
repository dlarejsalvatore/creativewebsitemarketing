According to Google, drafts and experiments are only available for Search and Display Network campaigns. You wonâ€™t be able to create a draft or experiment for Video, App or Shopping campaigns.

If are running Search and/or Display campaigns but still don&#039;t see &quot;Drafts and Experiments,&quot; you may need to click the &quot;+ More&quot; button at the bottom of the gray left hand menu. Sometimes there are additional tabs that are hidden in this section.

I hope this info helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) new consumer concerns: I recommend brainstorming with your team on how you can leverage these shifts in consumer behavior to not only support your customer base but also inspire them and show them that you genuinely care through your content or service.
2) Increased night searches: people are searching more at night leading to an increase in impressions during this hour.
3) Misleading intent: Now more than ever it is essential to pay close attention to your Google ad account.
4) focus on covid 19 responses: This one is kind of a no-brainer but it&#039;s really important during the crisis to be as responsive to your prospect and customer needs.]]></description>

Hi Victoria - If you click on &quot;Browse,&quot; it should show a list of different audience types. Custom audiences will be the last option on the list. Note that custom audiences can only be applied to display, video, Discovery or Gmail campaigns, so custom audiences will not be on the list if you&#039;re looking in another campaign type, such as Search. 

I just updated the blog post with a new section, &lt;strong&gt;How to Apply a Custom Audience&lt;/strong&gt;, since this question has come up more than once. Hopefully that information will be helpful. Thanks!]]></description>

Hey Trenton - Try going into an existing campaign or ad group and navigating to the &quot;Audiences&quot; tab on the lefthand menu. Then click the blue edit button. You should be able to find an existing custom audience from there (or create a new one) and add it to your campaign/ad group. I hope that helps!]]></description>
