This gives you a greater chance of producing relevant and effective ads. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">Rest assured, you don\u2019t have to fill out all 15 headlines for each ad you create, but Google recommends at least 5.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">The character limits for headlines and descriptions remain the same as a text ad\u2013 30 and 90 characters, respectively. There are also 2 display paths for the URL, each with 15 available characters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-965\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-3-1024x381.png\" alt=\"Variety Is Key\" width=\"629\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-3-1024x381.png 1024w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-3-300x112.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-3-768x286.png 768w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-3.png 1178w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">Variety Is Key<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">To maximize the different combinations of your ad and capitalize on machine learning, avoid writing headlines and descriptions that say the same thing in different ways. In fact, if your headlines or descriptions are too similar or repetitive, Google may not show your ad at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">So change it up! Go beyond stating your brand name and a keyword or two. Use the plentiful asset options to highlight enticing aspects of your business. Try different headline lengths. Write some with keywords included and some without. Include your traditional ad copy in some descriptions, and get more creative in others. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">The more variety you provide in your assets, the more opportunity Google\u2019s machine learning will have to find out what truly works. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">Keep in mind that because Google will mix and match the different headlines and descriptions, the elements should be able to make sense in any order. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-966\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5-2-1024x373.png\" alt=\"Avoid Pins\" width=\"628\" height=\"229\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5-2-1024x373.png 1024w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5-2-300x109.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5-2-768x280.png 768w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5-2.png 1185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">Avoid &#8220;Pins&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">Advertisers have the option to \u201cpin\u201d headlines or descriptions, locking them into certain positions and guaranteeing them to show. For example, you can choose to pin the name of your brand into position 1 of the headline, and it will always show up as the ad\u2019s first headline. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">On one hand, this gives you more control over the final appearance and messaging of your ad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000;font-size: 100%\">On the other hand, however, pinning interferes with the optimization process. It gives Google less flexibility to test out different orders and combinations of your assets, which can hinder its ability to find the best performing variations of your ad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;font-size: 100%\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to <\/span><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/10\/responsive-search-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">WordStream<\/span><\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, pinning a single headline reduces the amount of testing Google can perform on these ads by more than 75%. Therefore, unless necessary, advertisers should avoid using pins in responsive search ads.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;font-size: 100%\"><b>When can I start using responsive search ads?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;font-size: 100%\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although these ads are still in beta, they are currently available to all Google Ads accounts in English, French, German, Spanish, Japanese, and <\/span><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/7684791?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">other select languages<\/span><\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.
