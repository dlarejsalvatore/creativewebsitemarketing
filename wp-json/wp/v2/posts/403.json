Why? <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000\">Today\u2019s consumers tend to be wary of where they give out their money and personal information\u2014and rightfully so. We\u2019ve all heard news stories of companies who mishandled sensitive client information or engaged in unethical practices.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Events like these have informed the purchasing decisions of today\u2019s consumers, who have become more aware and more selective of where they bring their business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Consumers now take into account many factors when determining which companies to patron, such as online reviews, privacy policies, and company reputations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">For businesses, this brings up an important question\u2014How can you get consumers to trust you in the digital age?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Brand authenticity plays a big role in gaining the trust of consumers online. Content marketing is a great opportunity for businesses to showcase authenticity by telling their story and communicating their values.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Below, find four content marketing strategies for building brand authenticity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-404\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Transparent.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"622\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Transparent.png 820w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Transparent-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Transparent-768x292.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">Be Transparent <\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Today&#8217;s consumers crave authenticity. Companies who make unsubstantiated claims, appear \u201ctoo good to be true,\u201d or lack personality will likely lose the trust of today\u2019s cautious and skeptical consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">In order to build trust in their brand, companies must be transparent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">What does this mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Don&#8217;t overpromise. Don&#8217;t conceal aspects of your business from customers. Don&#8217;t be shady.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Instead, be honest about what you offer. Set realistic expectations of what your customers will receive from you. And if you make a mistake, own up to it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Transparency can take different shapes depending on your business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">A restaurant, for example, could be transparent by describing their ingredients on their website, explaining where they come from and how they&#8217;re prepared. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000\">A non-profit, on the other hand, might create a chart showing what their donations have been used for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">There are countless ways to be transparent and honest online, and today&#8217;s consumers will reward you for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-405\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Process.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"238\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Process.png 820w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Process-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Process-768x292.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">Showcase Your Process<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">The piles of paperwork, the two-hour meetings, the endless cups of coffee, the late nights, the creative ideas bounced off co-workers\u2014all of this is part of a company\u2019s <em>process<\/em>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Everything from the way ideas are born to the way they are executed comprises your process, and each company\u2019s is different. Creating content that showcases your unique process can be a useful tool when it comes to demonstrating brand authenticity to consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Your process can illuminate your values to your customers. For example, posting a Facebook <strong>photo<\/strong> of paperwork spread out on the desk can convey values of hard work and creativity.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000\">A <strong>short video<\/strong> of a brainstorming meeting in which employees are pitching ideas or engaging in funny banter can convey a positive company culture as well as values of collaboration and innovation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">In addition to elucidating your values, showcasing your process can help reveal the personality of your brand. Showing personality is key to engaging today\u2019s consumers. Another way to display personality other than by showcasing your process is by utilizing humor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-406\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Humor.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"619\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Humor.png 820w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Humor-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Humor-768x292.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">Use Humor<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">When used appropriately, humor can be an exceptionally effective tool to help your brand connect and build trust with consumers. Today\u2019s consumers rarely respond to impersonal marketing; they feel more engaged when a brand displays personality. Consumers are more likely to trust you if they can relate to you, and if they can sense there are real people behind the brand rather than just algorithms and automation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Social media platforms are an ideal place to incorporate humor into your marketing strategy. For example, posting a funny <strong>gif<\/strong> with a relatable caption can show a sense of humor that consumers can connect with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 180px\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><em>When the office runs out of coffee&#8230;<\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><img class=\" wp-image-409 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/michael-scott-gif.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"274\" height=\"207\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Funny <strong>comments<\/strong> or <strong>replies<\/strong> on social media can also showcase a sense of humor.

If consumers can tell that your brand is creative, relatable, and having fun, they are more likely to trust you, rather than think you\u2019re out to manipulate them into spending money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-413\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Unique-Story.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"622\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Unique-Story.png 820w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Unique-Story-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Banner-Unique-Story-768x292.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">Tell Your Unique Story<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">In addition to highlighting your process and incorporating humor into your digital strategy, telling your unique story also helps build brand authenticity. Every company has a story, but not every company shares that story effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Sharing your story with consumers builds trust, as it shows consumers who you are. Dedicate an <strong>About Us<\/strong> section on your website to explain to consumers who you are. Include answers to questions such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">How long has your company been in business?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">How did you get involved in this industry?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">What is the vision that drives you?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Illuminate what goals and values lie behind the brand, its practices, and its products and\/or services. Share what drives and inspires you, and it will resonate with readers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Furthermore, companies should spend time reflecting on what sets them apart. Are you a small, family business? Is your CEO a first-generation American? Are you a woman-owned business? Finding and emphasizing these unique qualities about your company can give you a competitive edge and distinguish you from others in your industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">All of these strategies invite consumers to see beyond your products and services; instead, they are able to see you as a genuine, trustworthy, and relatable brand with whom they are willing to engage. By creating content that showcases your process, uses humor, and shares your story, marketers can shape the narrative of their brand into one that resonates with consumers\u2014a brand with history, personality, and <strong>authenticity<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong>Check out Part 1 &amp; 2 of our Contenting Marketing Series below:<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Part 1: <a href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2018\/03\/30\/beyond-blog-posts-delivering-content-through-new-formats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beyond Blog Posts &#8211; Delivering Content Through New Formats<\/a><br \/><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000\">Part 2: <a href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2018\/04\/06\/the-value-of-interactive-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Value of Interactive Content<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">To learn more about how to optimize your digital strategy, contact Creative Website Marketing <span style=\"color: #0000ff\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/#contact\">here<\/a><\/span>.<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>Creative Website Marketing is a digital marketing agency in Nashville, TN, helping businesses throughout the country execute strategic brand awareness + lead generation efforts.<\/i><\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why is brand authenticity important?
