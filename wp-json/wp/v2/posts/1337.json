In fact, Google Ads can provide a high ROI while being a tremendously useful tool to grow brand awareness and generate leads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, trouble can occur when campaigns lack <span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2018\/06\/19\/the-understated-value-of-adwords-campaign-structure\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strategic set-up <\/a><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and management. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In those instances, a company\u2019s Google Ads budget can end up going to irrelevant clicks, meaning they fail to drive qualified traffic to their site. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a result, users do not convert, and KPIs fall short of expectations.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">When some companies see this happen, they might think PPC marketing doesn\u2019t work. They may stop investing in Google Ads or eliminate their paid advertising efforts altogether.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">However, we believe that\u2019s a mistake. Here\u2019s why:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">According to <span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/18\/brand-awareness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wordstream<\/a><\/span>, paid search ads can increase brand awareness by 80%. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/what-makes-people-click-on-search-ads-309959\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Search Engine Land<\/a><\/span> found that 63% of people will<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0click on a Google ad. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PPC visitors are 50% more likely to purchase something than organic, according to Unbounce<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On average, businesses make $2 in for every $1 they spend in Google Ads.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">With 5.6 billion searches per day on Google, your target audience is out there. The key is getting your ads in front of them, and avoiding clicks that do not generate engagement and leads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Whether your budget is big or small, you can optimize your campaigns so that your money is spent <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">effectively<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">Below, find 5 strategies to maximize your budget in Google Ads.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1348 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1-4.png\" alt=\"Paid search ads statistic \" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1-4.png 560w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1-4-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Targeting<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Google Ads offers several different targeting options. One of the easiest is location targeting, which allows advertisers to select locations in which ads will show. Locations can be as broad as an entire country or state, or as granular as a specific zip code. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">We also recommend reviewing the Locations dropdown in your campaign settings. Under Location Options, there are different settings for how Google will apply your location targeting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">The default is to target \u201cPeople in, or showing interest in, these locations.\u201d However, sometimes this can lead to searches and clicks from people far outside your targeted locations. If you see numerous clicks from irrelevant locations, try changing the settings to \u201cPeople in these locations.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1338 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-06-at-11.59.20-AM.png\" alt=\"Location Options Google Ads\" width=\"537\" height=\"176\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-06-at-11.59.20-AM.png 537w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-06-at-11.59.20-AM-300x98.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">This means your ads will only show for searches conducted by people physically in your targeted locations. This can reduce the number of irrelevant clicks and, therefore, reduce wasted spend in your account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Other targeting methods include <span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2019\/04\/23\/what-are-custom-intent-audiences-in-google-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custom intent audiences<\/a><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, remarketing lists, affinity audiences, demographics, income-level, and more. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Targeting helps your ads be seen by the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">right people<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> at the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">right time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, meaning you will be paying for clicks with the potential to generate engagement and conversions. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Negative Keywords<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Are you using negative keywords in your Google Ads account? If not, you may be paying for irrelevant clicks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">To build a negative keyword list, regularly check the Search Terms Report in Google Ads. This report shows which search queries caused your ad to appear. Scan the list for irrelevant terms. Depending on what you see, you may just need to adjust your keyword match types; however, you can also add terms as negative keywords. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">For example, say you sell eyeglasses, but your Search Terms Report shows you\u2019ve spent around $100 a week on clicks from people searching for \u201cwine glasses.\u201d To remedy this, add \u201cwine\u201d as a negative keyword, and your ad will no longer show for search queries including that word. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">As a result, that $100 per week will no longer be spent on an irrelevant audience. This reduces wasted spend in your Google Ads account and, in turn, gives your campaigns more money to spend on qualified clicks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1376 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blog-Reduce-Wasted-PPC-Spend-Stats.png\" alt=\"Google Ads statistic\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blog-Reduce-Wasted-PPC-Spend-Stats.png 560w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Blog-Reduce-Wasted-PPC-Spend-Stats-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Topics &amp; Placements <\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">For display campaigns, topics and placements give you more control over where your ads show up throughout the internet. <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Topics<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: From a list provided by Google, choose topics your target audience may be interested in. Then, various sites &amp; apps on the Google Display Network (GDN) with content relating to those topics will display your ad. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Placements<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Select specific websites, mobile apps or YouTube channels on the GDN where you want your ad to show. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">You can also exclude certain topics and placements in order to prevent your ads from showing in irrelevant places across the GDN.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">For example, say your company sells high-end, designer sunglasses. Under the Topics tab in Google Ads, you can choose \u201cLuxury Goods\u201d from the Shopping category. As a result, your ads will show on sites and apps relating to luxury goods. Meanwhile, you can exclude the topic \u201cDiscount &amp; Outlet Stores,\u201d as users shopping on those types of sites are likely not your target audience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How does this help maximize your budget? Rather than your display ads showing up all across the Google Display Network, these methods allow you to put your ads where they can reach your target audience and get <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">meaningful<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> clicks. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In other words, this helps you pay for clicks that are more likely to result in engagement and conversions.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1339 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-5.png\" alt=\"Display Advertising Statistic\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-5.png 560w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/4-5-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">To see which sites, apps and YouTube channels actually displayed your ads, go to the Placements tab and navigate to \u201cWhere Your Ads Showed.\u201d Monitor this list periodically for any locations that should be added to your exclusions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Especially when combined with other targeting methods, topics and placements can help your ads be seen by the right people, which means you will be using your budget to pay for qualified, relevant clicks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Relevant (and Fast) Landing Pages<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Another element to reducing wasted ad spend is directing users to a relevant landing page. Otherwise, users will click through to your site only to leave it shortly thereafter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, if people click on your ad for <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Travel Tips For Visiting Europe<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, then end up on a page about the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Best Restaurants in America<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, they\u2019re likely going to leave the page and return to the search engine results page (SERP).<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">This means that you just paid for a click that did not lead to engagement of any kind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Without a relevant landing page, you will not only pay for irrelevant clicks, but your bounce rate will increase. This signals a poor landing page experience to Google. As a result, your ad becomes less likely to show up at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">To avoid this, make sure your ad directs users to the correct URL. Ensure the keywords and ad copy accurately portray what users will find on your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1341 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-4.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Statistic\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-4.png 560w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-4-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, your landing page needs to load <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">quickly<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, especially on mobile. According to Google, 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Check your mobile site speed score on the Landing Pages tab in Google Ads. For each landing page included in your campaigns, you\u2019ll see a score out of 10. The higher your score, the quicker your site speed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A relevant and fast-loading landing page will help reduce the number of users who click on your ad then abandon the page without taking an action.
