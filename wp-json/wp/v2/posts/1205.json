Custom intent is the most granular audience targeting method available, helping advertisers target people who are already on the buying journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">PPC marketers build these lists by entering specific URLs, keywords, and\/or apps into a list. Google identifies users who have visited those websites, searched for those keywords, or used those apps. Those users will then see your ad throughout the Google Display Network or YouTube.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>How is this different than other audience targeting?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Custom Intent vs. Affinity Audiences<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom intent audiences are different than affinity audiences because the targeting focuses on <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intent<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not interest. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Affinity audiences are great for building brand awareness and expanding your reach, but not necessarily for driving conversions. Custom intent audiences, however, identify and focus on users who are ready to make a purchase relevant to your business. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Custom Intent vs. In-Market Audiences<\/strong> <\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">These two audience targeting methods are very similar, as both try to identify users with purchasing intent. However, custom intent audiences are more targeted than in-market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">When creating in-market audiences, advertisers must choose from a pre-populated list of topics. Google then identifies users whose browser behavior indicates they\u2019re considering a purchase within that category. This is great for targeting mid-funnel consumers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">However, because the in-market topics are fairly generic, you may end up targeting people who do not fit your intended audience. This can result in wasted media spend. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Custom intent audiences get more granular, as to actually select specific websites that a user has visited and keywords they\u2019ve searched. This allows advertisers to take their targeting a step further and hone in on lower-funnel consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">For example, say you sell high-end, designer handbags. Using an in-market audience, you can target someone who is looking to purchase a handbag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img class=\"wp-image-1206 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-2.56.54-PM.png\" alt=\"In-Market Audience Targeting\" width=\"684\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-2.56.54-PM.png 904w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-2.56.54-PM-300x123.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-2.56.54-PM-768x314.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">However, that is still somewhat general. Since your company sells high-end handbags, you don\u2019t want to target a user looking for discounted or knock-off handbags. Chances are, if that user clicked your ad, went to your site, and saw your prices, he or she would not end up converting. In a PPC campaign, that results in wasted media spend. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, by using a custom intent audience, you could input URLs of competitors with similar prices and target users who have shopped on those sites. Plus, you can input more specific, long-tail keywords like <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">high-end handbags<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">genuine designer handbags<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">luxury handbags<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and more to make sure you appeal to exactly the right consumers. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>How do I create custom intent audiences?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Just as with the other audience targeting methods in Google Ads, you create custom intent audiences through the Audiences tab. There are two options for generating the audience list. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first option is the <\/span>automated<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> approach. With this option, Google uses artificial intelligence (AI) to build the audience. With the <\/span>manual<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> option, you hand-pick the keywords, URLs, and apps used to build your audience. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">To be clear, the URLs and apps you choose don\u2019t mean that your ads will show up on those websites or apps. Instead, Google shows your ad throughout the Display Network, or on YouTube (more on that below), to users who have accessed the URLs and apps you identify. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Can I apply custom intent audiences to any campaign?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom intent audiences are currently available for <\/span><b>display<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><b>YouTube<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> campaigns. The guidelines are slightly different for the two ad formats when it comes to developing the audience. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Advertisers can only use keywords, not URLs or apps, to build custom intent audiences for YouTube. Google recommends adding at least 50 keywords for each audience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">To create custom intent audiences for display ads, you can input keywords, URLs, and apps. For best results, avoid general, low-intent keywords, and keep your audience focused around a particular product or service offering.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Summary: Why should I use custom intent audiences?<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">1. To reach your target audience when they&#8217;re ready to make a purchase<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Because you are able to target users who open certain apps, visit specific URLs, and search for long-tail keywords, you can target users who have buying intent related to your products or services. This allows you to reach the right consumers at the right time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">2. To reduce wasted media spend<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Targeting broad groups of people who may or may not be interested in buying from your business often results in paying for unqualified clicks. By showing your ad to a very targeted group of people who&#8217;ve demonstrated intent to purchase a product or service that your business sells, you should only spend money on clicks with the potential to convert.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">3. To improve your campaign metrics<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Although your overall click volume may decrease, the clicks you receive will be more qualified. This means that you&#8217;ll likely see your clickthrough rate (CTR) and conversions increase, and your cost per acquisition (CPA) decrease. When your PPC goal is to drive conversions, these are indicators of an effective campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to learn more about custom intent audiences?
