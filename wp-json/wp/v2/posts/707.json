In fact, ComScore predicts that <\/span><b>more than half of all searches will be done via voice by 2020.<\/b> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Voice search technology enables people to search the web using spoken words, rather than typing in their search terms. This mode of searching has been popularized by technology such as Siri, the voice search feature on iPhones, as well as \u201csmart speakers\u201d like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These digital assistants allow people to ask verbal questions and receive prompt replies, without even pushing a button. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the world of digital marketing, where so much has been built around text searches, this trend will undoubtedly generate change. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How can digital marketers prepare for this paradigm shift?<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">Two keys to taking advantage of voice search:<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-709\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1-in-6.png\" alt=\"Voice Speaker Statistic \" width=\"431\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1-in-6.png 800w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1-in-6-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1-in-6-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>1. Use Natural-Sounding Language<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Voice searches come as a spoken question or statement. As a result, the phrasing is often different from that of a typed search.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">These differences occur because people speak to their digital assistants the way they would normally talk in a conversation, as opposed to the shortened, abbreviated way we typically type out our search queries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, if someone is thinking of buying a new TV, they might type into Google, <em>Best TV brands<\/em>. However, a voice search would likely sound something like, <em>Hey Google, what TV should I buy?<\/em><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">For marketers, this indicates a shift in the keywords that will become more common with the rise of voice search. Long-tail keywords will become more popular, mimicking natural speech patterns rather than the concise language of typical text searches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">This means that, in addition to targeting these keywords in paid search, businesses will need to incorporate these longer keywords and phrases into their websites and content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Strategies for integrating these natural-language phrases include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Incorporate long-tail keywords in blog post headers and sub-heads<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Add a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section to your website with questions and topics that mirror voice search queries<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Create content that answers the basics of your products or services, such as who, what, when, where, why, and how<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Strive for readable, conversational content<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Perform keyword research to determine the questions your target audience is asking\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-710\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chart.png\" alt=\"Voice Search Chart\" width=\"459\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chart.png 800w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chart-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chart-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>2. Focus on User Intent<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to focusing on shifting keywords and language patterns, marketers must consider user intent with regard to voice search. According to Google, <\/span><b>voice searches are 30 times more likely to be action queries than text searches.<\/b> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">In fact, many people search by voice when they\u2019re already on the go. This means that often times, people are using voice search to make purchases (i.e. ordering pizza) or to find places to patron (i.e. searching for nearby restaurants).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">In order to capitalize on the intent of these users, marketers should craft content that directly answers typical search questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Furthermore, local businesses should utilize keywords such as the name of their city or state, as well as focusing on getting positive user reviews to increase local search rankings. These businesses should also be sure to register on third-party apps and local directories to increase exposure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">How popular is voice search already?<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-711\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Infographic.png\" alt=\"Voice Search Infographic \" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Infographic.png 800w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Infographic-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Infographic-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Northstar Research estimates that in the US, over 50% of teens and 41% of adults use voice search daily.
