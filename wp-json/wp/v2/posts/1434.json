The event, as usual, included the announcement of innovative new products and features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">As digital marketers, we found the Ads Innovation Keynote especially relevant.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Google used the almost 75-minute presentation to discuss not only new products but also its approach to marketing trends, its commitment to user privacy, and its vision for the future of online advertising. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Below, find<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0a complete recap of the Google Marketing Live\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Ads Innovation Keynote<\/span> from\u00a0<span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Creative Website Marketing<\/span>.<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>3 Marketing \u201cRevolutions\u201d<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Before launching into new product announcements, Google\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Philipp Schindler, set the stage for the event by identifying 3 key areas of digital marketing that are driving Google forward:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Mobile<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Machine learning<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Privacy<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Mobile<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Mobile has become the primary platform for consumer engagement. Trillions of searches occur every year on Google, and over half of them happen on mobile devices. The Google assistant is already on more than a billion devices worldwide. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google will continue innovating new ways to enhance mobile engagement, including <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2018\/08\/01\/the-rise-of-voice-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline\">voice search<\/span><\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, augmented reality, and more.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Machine Learning<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">In recent years, the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technology have been fast and profound. Schindler used the example of Google\u2019s language translation feature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Just a few years ago, you&#8217;d have to manually type words or phrases into Google Translate to get a result. Now, you can simply point your camera at anything written in a different language, and read it as if it were written in your own language. Your phone can even read it to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Machine learning has also allowed for vast innovations in digital marketing. In fact, AI has made many of the new Google products announced at this event possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Privacy<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Conveying its efforts to respect and protect user data, Google emphasized and reiterated the importance of privacy throughout the keynote. For example, Schindler stated that Google is continuing to \u201cheavily invest\u201d in tools like Analytics and Ads Data Hub that are built with privacy at their core.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1442 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1-5.png\" alt=\"Quote from Google Marketing Live 2019\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1-5.png 560w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1-5-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>How is Google improving its platforms for digital marketers?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Schindler identified 4 main areas where Google has used feedback from marketers to make improvements in Google Ads and beyond. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">The new marketing products and features from Google are intended to address the following needs from digital marketers:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> More <\/span><b>insights<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that marketers can act on<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Ways to plan by<\/span><b> customer<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> instead of by channel<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> More ways to test and tell stories using the <\/span><b>assets marketers already have<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> More ways to <\/span><b>measure impact<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> while protecting user privacy<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>What new products did Google announce?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Okay, okay \u2013 on to the good stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Prabhakar Raghavan, Senior Vice President of Ads, kicked off the announcements of Google\u2019s new products and features. These innovations are designed to help marketers answer the following questions:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How can we <\/span><b>be responsible<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with user data?<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How can we <\/span><b>be there<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> during the customer journey?<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How can we <\/span><b>be useful<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to the customer, at all stages of their journey?<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>New Ad Formats<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Discovery Ads<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">The aptly named discovery ads will meet consumers in locations where they\u2019re open to discovering something new. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These ads will feature a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">swipeable image carousel and additional information about the corresponding product or service. They\u2019ll show up in different feeds where user intent is to discover new things, including the YouTube home feed, Gmail promotions and social tabs, and the Discover feed on Google.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Machine learning plays an integral part in this ad format. Advertisers simply provide high quality image assets, and Google\u2019s machine learning does the rest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What\u2019s the benefit of these ads? By finding users in moments where they\u2019re open to discovering new products, services, or brands, discover ads can help marketers expose their products to more people. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Google, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">85% of online consumers will take a product-related action within 24 hours of discovering a product that meets their needs. This includes researching, comparing prices, and even buying the product. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thus, discover ads can help marketers grow their audience and cultivate new customers. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This ad format will roll out to all advertisers globally later this year.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1437 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-5.png\" alt=\"Quote from Google Marketing Live 2019, Prabhakar Raghavan\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-5.png 560w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-5-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Gallery Ads<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Sissie Hsiao, Vice President of Mobile App Advertising Product Management, introduced the next new ad format, Gallery Ads. Specifically designed for mobile users, Gallery Ads appear at the top of the SERP and seek to combine the higher intent of search with the more visual format of display ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Gallery Ads consist of images along with text. When users tap on the ad, an interactive image gallery pops up, allowing users to swipe through multiple images. A text headline shows at the top, and taglines are included beneath each image. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">75% of smartphone users expect immediate information when they\u2019re searching on their phones. This ad format conveys both text-based and visual information to users, right on the SERP. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">As a result, users get quicker access to more comprehensive information about your product or service. Interested users can click to continue on to your site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Galleries can include 4-8 photos, with 70 character descriptions beneath each image. Marketers can provide up to 3 headlines. This enables advertisers to test different ad copy and calls to action (CTAs).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Do Gallery Ads work? According to Hsiao, on average, campaigns utilizing Gallery Ads have seen 25% more interactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>New Smart Bidding Capabilities <\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">The next speaker, Anthony Chavez, Director of Product Management in Google Ads, shifted away from ad formats to talk about new smart bidding capabilities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One new smart bidding strategy, <\/span><b>Maximize Conversion Value<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, will give marketers more flexibility to optimize for what matters most. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With <\/span><b>campaign-level conversion optimization<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, marketers can choose the conversions they want to optimize for at the campaign level. Because different campaigns may have different goals, this will help the smart bidding process to become even more effective.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chavez also discussed <\/span><b>conversion value rules<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> where you can assign different values to a conversion depending on the customer\u2019s value. Say your business has a list of customers who spend significantly more than a typical customer. That means that conversions from those customers have a different value to your business. Smart bidding can adjust based on these rules in order to accurately and efficiently optimize for valuable conversions. This also helps you understand the true impact of the conversions you receive. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finally, Chavez introduced <\/span><b>seasonality adjustments<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Smart bidding is based on machine learning and data. But s<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ometimes, historical data is not useful to predict future performance\u2013 for example, if your business has a big sale coming up in the summer.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">With seasonality adjustments, marketers can let Google know the dates of the sale or seasonal event, as well as the changes in conversion rate to expect during that time. The smart bidding models will adjust their bids based these changes. Once the sale or event is over, the smart bidding strategy will exclude data from that time period going forward, since it was part of an anomaly and not indicative of continuous performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Video Ads <\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Following the smart bidding updates, Google introduced its next speaker, Nicky Rettke, Director of Product Management for YouTube Ads. With the tremendous popularity of video in 2019, this segment of the keynote was especially interesting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Rettke revealed that YouTube has over 2 billion signed-in users visiting the platform every month. And with this wide consumption of video content, user expectations have shifted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">\u201cUsers expect delightful, creative video wherever they are &#8211; on mobile, TV, and beyond,\u201d said Rettke.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">However, many marketers struggle to produce high-quality video content on a consistent basis. Feedback from businesses and digital marketing agencies has expressed that video production can be costly, time-intensive, and complex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Google cited this feedback as inspiration for creating a new product that allows marketers to easily repurpose existing videos into short advertisements, courtesy of machine learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1438 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/3-8.png\" alt=\"Quote from Google Marketing Live 2019, Nicky Rettke\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/3-8.png 560w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/3-8-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Bumper Machine<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Launching later this year, the bumper machine is a new tool that will allow marketers to generate 6 second video ads, or bumper ads, directly in Google Ads. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">How does the bumper machine work?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Provide a link to one of your YouTube videos that\u2019s under 90 seconds<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">In the span of a few minutes, the Bumper Machine will produce 3-4 video ads, each 6 seconds long<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">That\u2019s it! To give advertisers control over final audio and visual elements, editing features are available. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Using machine learning, this tool evaluates the original YouTube video for elements like motion, contrast, and faces. It then generates a short video that, according to Google, will prominently feature your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">For companies without the budget or time to devote to video ad production, this could make a huge impact, making it possible to create compelling new videos from existing creative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Are 6 second videos effective? Compared to 30 second video ads, 6 second bumper ads result in 107% higher recall and 134% higher purchase intent from consumers. So in other words, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">yes<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>New Audience Targeting Tools<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Custom Audiences<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Merging custom affinity with <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2019\/04\/23\/what-are-custom-intent-audiences-in-google-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">custom intent audiences<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, the custom audiences tool enables you to build an audience using keywords, websites &amp; apps, and apply it across different campaign formats including Gmail, YouTube, Discovery &amp; Display. This targeting tool can help marketers reach the right people across a variety of different campaign types. Furthermore, the audience can be adjusted using the Audience Expansion tool, explained below.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Audience Expansion tool<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">This new feature will make it easier to find people similar to those in your audiences. Visualize the tool as a slider\u2013\u00a0to broaden your reach, you can drag the slider to the right. Move it to the left to narrow the audience back down and more explicitly align with the audience traits selected in your custom audience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">How effective is this tool? Advertisers using it with display campaigns have seen up to 50% more conversions with the same budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Display &amp; Video 360 Updates<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">The presenter also touched on Display &amp; Video 360, a part of the Google Marketing Platform in which marketers manage their display, video, TV and audio campaigns. To meet demand for content across multiple platforms, Google will implement several changes in Display &amp; Video 360.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mobile searches for podcasts have grown over 85% in the last two years. With <\/span><b>audio ad inventory <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in Display &amp; Video 360, marketers can connect with consumers when they\u2019re listening to podcasts or other audio content on Google Play music, Spotify, and more.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">73% of U.S. households have a connected TV. Google will enable<\/span> <b>connected TV campaigns<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, to help advertisers reach people watching premium TV content through streaming services. Additionally, Google <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">will provide access to <\/span><b>national networks and local TV stations<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">All changes will take place starting in fall 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1441 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/6-1.png\" alt=\"Quote from Google Marketing Live 2019, Prabhakar Raghavan\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/6-1.png 560w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/6-1-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Google Shopping updates<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Homepage &amp; Purchasing Feature<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Oliver Heckmann, Vice President of Engineering for Shopping &amp; Travel, revealed exciting changes in Google Shopping. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">A new Google Shopping homepage will offer personalized recommendations, while still allowing users to search for products and filter by features or brands. The product pages feature images, reviews, and videos of people unboxing and using the item.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">As always, users can choose the buying option that works best for them, whether it\u2019s from the retailer\u2019s website or going to the physical store. However, now customers have an additional option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Similar to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2019\/03\/29\/what-is-instagram-checkout-what-does-it-mean-for-digital-marketers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram&#8217;s new in-app purchasing feature<\/a><\/span><\/span>, users will be able to purchase products directly from a retailer through Google Shopping. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">This simplifies the checkout process, and the transaction is backed by a Google guarantee. The feature will be available through voice search on the Google assistant, as well as through Google search, Google images, and YouTube.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">The coolest part of this announcement? Users will be able to directly buy products they see in YouTube videos, while the video is still playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Advertisers need to sign up for the Shopping Actions program to sell products this way. The feature is currently available in France, but will be available in the U.S. in the coming months.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Showcase Shopping Ads<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Showcase shopping ads integrate more visual content into a shopping ad. The ad can actually display more than one image at once, in an effort to better engage and inform consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Over 80% of the traffic from showcase shopping ads to a retailer\u2019s website are new visitors. The ad format is available now, and will expand this year to Google images, YouTube, and the Discover feed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Shopping Campaign with Partners<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">This new setting allows retailers to accept additional budgets from brand partners in Google Ads. In turn, the brand partners can decide which products or product categories they want to promote with that additional budget. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">This beta program has shown to increase both online &amp; in-store conversions.

The donut and coffee company saw an increase of 4x their monthly customers by using local campaigns. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Another study of 10 advertisers across the globe who used local campaigns revealed significant results. These businesses saw a median of 5x incremental ROAS (return on ad spend) from their in-store sales. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Google will soon expand local campaigns to include new options such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Displaying different product lines for users to explore before they even get to the store<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Promoted locations in Maps<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Promoted pins in Maps when someone is planning a route to a destination, or as they are navigating<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #474545\"><b>Google Trips<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Google.com\/travel is seeking to change the way people plan for trips. The feature allows users to explore different destinations and things to do there, including sample day plans that are created just for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">The Flight and Hotel tabs help users browse through different options. Users can even make accommodations for airfare and lodging directly from Google. If you\u2019re not ready to book a flight yet, the Google flight price tracker will monitor prices and inform you when they move up or down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Heckmann noted that users can save relevant information, then pause and come back, picking up their research where they left off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">As users purchase flight tickets, book a hotel, and make restaurant reservations, Google Trips creates a timeline displaying the information. It does this automatically using email confirmations from Gmail. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">How does this enhanced travel planning experience, which is available now, help marketers? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">This feature makes it easier for advertisers to reach people who are actively looking for products, services, and experiences. It helps marketers identify high intent customers and influence their decisions. As a result, advertisers can drive more qualified leads.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Protecting User Privacy<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">The keynote wrapped up with Senior Product Manager Chetna Bindra. She transitioned from new product announcements to a discussion on privacy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Bindra noted that today&#8217;s consumers are losing trust in how their data gets collected and used. As a result, she feels that marketers must emphasize data transparency and take concrete steps to ensure consumers&#8217; privacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">She announced the following steps Google is taking to enhance user privacy: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Changes in the Chrome browser that make it easier for users to block or clear third party cookies <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">New restrictions on fingerprinting<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">New tools to give transparency into the data used to personalize ads and the companies involved<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">How can digital marketers help protect user privacy?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Be clear about what data you collect from people and why <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Build more direct relationships with your users <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Understand and respect preferences to privacy<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">She gave an example: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">If an advertiser can\u2019t personalize an ad because a user has opted out or cookies are restricted, Google\u2019s machine learning can use the context of the page where the ad is displayed to maximize relevance. This helps ensure a positive user experience while respecting personal privacy preferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1440 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5-3.png\" alt=\"Quote from Google Marketing Live 2019\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5-3.png 560w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5-3-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Google\u2019s Vision For the Future of Digital Marketing <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">After identifying influential trends, announcing new products, and discussing the importance of privacy, Google Marketing Live&#8217;s Ads Innovation Keynote came to a close. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Bindra concluded the keynote with Google\u2019s vision of how online advertising should work in 2019:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">\u201cAdvertising has to work for everyone, because when it does, users can get access to information and great content for free.
