Assure customers that you\u2019re still operating, and include a strong call to action that motivates them to click through to your site and buy from you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Remarket to users who visited your site but didn\u2019t make a purchase. Offering a coupon code, for instance, can entice users to re-visit your site and convert.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">In addition to driving existing customers to your website, focus on bringing in new, targeted traffic. On Facebook, for example, creating new lookalike audiences allows you to expand your targeting footprint to reach an even wider audience. On Google Ads, create paid search ads to market your products or services when consumers are actively searching for them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Then, once a user is on your site, make it as easy as possible for them to make a purchase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">How can you create a seamless user experience (UX) for online customers?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Ensure your site loads quickly. Eliminate any unnecessary steps in the checkout process. Auto-fill forms when possible, and only ask for information you need. Allow users to checkout as guests, and once the purchase is complete, encourage them to create an account to streamline the next purchase. Offer customer support by phone, chat, or email, and respond in a timely manner.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The more seamless the checkout process, the more likely a user is to complete the purchase and return to your site in the future to buy from you again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;\">Checklist:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Use Facebook Shop<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Serve ads to past website visitors that have already engaged with your brand (remarketing ads)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Use customer data to build similar audiences to target using Facebook Ads<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Make it easy for customers to buy online from your website\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-789375896\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-276504435\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Reinvent Your Products and Services to Adapt<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">For industries that have come to almost a temporary halt like travel, events, hospitality, transportation, and more, there is an immediate need to reinvent how your products or services can adapt or pivot to serve consumers in a new way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">For example, travel companies can consider pre-selling future travel packages at a discount. Transportation companies can fill a void by transporting healthcare workers to and from the hospital, or offering food delivery services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Approaching your business in a new way requires creativity and flexibility.

Ads can highlight what you\u2019re doing to keep customers safe and comfortable. This not only showcases what your company has to offer, but also demonstrates your brand values.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">By acknowledging the uncertainty of the moment and communicating honestly and openly with your audience, you can reassure them that your business is working diligently to address their needs. This can not only help drive business in the short-term but also build long-term customer loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In addition to crafting strategic ad messaging, ensure that once a user clicks through to your site, it\u2019s easy for consumers to engage with you. This might mean adding a chat feature to your website, improving site speed, or streamlining the checkout process to make it as quick and easy as possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Consumers are juggling a lot right now. Many are working from home while taking care of children. Many are worried about losing their jobs. By making your site easy to use, and making it as easy as possible for users to get what they need, you help make your customers\u2019 lives a little bit easier. That makes it more likely they\u2019ll return to your site and use your products or services again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Whether you\u2019re offering telemedicine services or food delivery, using PPC to communicate with and reassure your customers can help drive business and build loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;\">Checklist:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Use ads to communicate with your customers\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Acknowledge consumer fears and uncertainty<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Reassure your business is working to meet their needs<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Demonstrate your brand values<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Ensure a positive website UX and streamline conversion processes<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-279738130\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-634159548\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner text-center\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"img has-hover x md-x lg-x y md-y lg-y\" id=\"image_744033225\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"img-inner dark\" >\n\t\t\t<img width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Site-Speed-Statistic-1-1.gif\" class=\"attachment-original size-original\" alt=\"Site speed statistic\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<style>\n#image_744033225 {\n  width: 70%;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n<style>\n#col-634159548 > .col-inner {\n  margin: 0px 0px 10px 0px;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-1171470882\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-720226483\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Tempted to Eliminate Paid Advertising? Consider This First<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In response to the impact of the coronavirus, many marketers may initially consider halting their PPC campaigns. While we certainly understand this inclination, we urge you to reconsider for several reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Firstly, pausing and restarting ad campaigns typically results in a higher cost per click (CPC), especially on Google Ads. Keeping your ads active can help keep CPCs more stable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Additionally, if your competitors continue to run ads, you could lose out on traffic and business by pausing your campaigns. Thus, before deciding to eliminate your campaigns, monitor your competitors to see if they are still running ads.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If you suspend your campaigns while your competitors continue advertising, they will continue being visible to customers, driving traffic and generating leads, while you disappear from the playing field.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Even if users don\u2019t convert right away, remaining visible on search engines and other PPC platforms allows you to build brand awareness and influence consideration. This can help earn you business when users are ready to convert at a later date.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-557606075\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-2087941044\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner text-center\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"img has-hover x md-x lg-x y md-y lg-y\" id=\"image_1600650592\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"img-inner dark\" >\n\t\t\t<img width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/PPC-Statistic-2-1.gif\" class=\"attachment-original size-original\" alt=\"Paid search statistic\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<style>\n#image_1600650592 {\n  width: 70%;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n<style>\n#col-2087941044 > .col-inner {\n  margin: 0px 0px 10px 0px;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-583757727\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-1652348058\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If your business has been heavily impacted by COVID-19 and you\u2019re unable to maintain operations, it might make sense to scale back your advertising spend.
