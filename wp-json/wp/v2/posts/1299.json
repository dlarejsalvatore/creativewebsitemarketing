Using tracking, analytics and reporting, digital marketing companies can monitor their efforts and evaluate performance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">In addition to basic metrics like ad clicks and cost-per-click (CPC), agencies can track specific user actions and key performance indicators (KPIs) based on your company\u2019s goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Tools like Google Tag Manager enable agencies to track phone calls, form submissions, website clicks and more that result from digital marketing efforts. Furthermore, Google Analytics provides metrics like bounce rate and session duration that measure user behavior and engagement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Reporting tools such as Google Data Studio allow agencies to transform the complex data they\u2019ve collected into visual, easy-to-understand reports. Ideally, the agency will be willing to walk through the report with you or summarize the results if needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">How are these reports helpful to your business? Reporting helps identify which strategies are working well and which have opportunities for improvement. This not only holds the agency accountable but gives your business the data it needs to inform future decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">Examples of using data to inform decisions:<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If your quarterly report shows Facebook ads are driving more form conversions at a lower cost than your ads on Twitter, you may choose to re-allocate some of your budget from Twitter to Facebook.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your Google search ads are driving a large volume of mobile users to your website, but they\u2019re converting at a lower rate than on desktop. You may need to check your mobile site speed or optimize your mobile <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2019\/04\/03\/4-keys-to-creating-landing-pages-that-convert\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">landing page to drive conversions.<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">With measurable results, businesses can see the impact of their online marketing efforts and let that data guide their actions going forward. This helps companies be as strategic and efficient as possible. Therefore, this is a tremendous benefit of working with a digital marketing agency.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Frees Up Your Time<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Digital marketing is complex. It takes time to learn different online tools, time to utilize different media platforms, and time to manage a variety of campaigns. When businesses are juggling numerous responsibilities, effectively executing digital marketing efforts can be a challenge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Content creation, SEO, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2017\/07\/28\/business-optimized-google-business-listing-bing-places-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google My Business listings<\/a><\/span><\/span>, social media posts, A\/B testing, Google Ads account management&#8230; All of these things are important, but they take <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013 especially to do them well.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">When a company outsources its digital marketing activities to an agency, therefore, it frees up a significant amount of time for its employees. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">As a result, in-house marketing teams will have more time to focus on other tasks and projects.

What exactly does that mean? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">It means that the agency first and foremost identifies your company\u2019s goals. They examine what\u2019s currently working, what\u2019s not, and which services they can offer to help you meet your objectives.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rather than taking a cookie-cutter approach, high-quality agencies will cultivate a customized strategy that\u2019s based around <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">you<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. When an agency puts your needs at the center of what they do, you\u2019ve likely found a good fit.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">A strong strategy lays the foundation for everything else. The services you receive from the agency will be purposeful and intentional, driven by achieving your goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">All of the factors listed above help agencies execute strong, strategic digital marketing efforts to help maximize your resources and meet your unique goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Interested in learning more about digital marketing services? <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/#contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Contact Creative Website Marketing today!<\/b><\/a><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Creative Website Marketing is a digital marketing agency in Nashville, TN, helping businesses throughout the country execute strategic brand awareness + lead generation efforts.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 2020, there have never been more opportunities for companies to use digital marketing to engage consumers and generate growth.
