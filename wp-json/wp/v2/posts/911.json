In fact, the entire website is really a collection of individual discussion forums, known as subreddits. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #282828;font-size: 105%\">Subreddits are discussion threads built around a particular topic, from sports teams and niche hobbies to popular TV shows. The subreddit for the TV show Game of Thrones, for example, had almost 8 million unique views last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #282828;font-size: 105%\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Users can give other people\u2019s posts upvotes or downvotes (likes or dislikes, basically), and engage by sharing their own comments. In 2018 alone, Reddit users posted over <\/span><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/redditblog.com\/2018\/12\/04\/reddit-year-in-review-2018\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1.2 billion comments<\/span><\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #282828;font-size: 105%\"><strong>What advertising options does Reddit offer?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #282828;font-size: 105%\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To capitalize on its popularity, Reddit has previously offered advertising opportunities in the form of promoted posts and video views. This has proved successful; according to <\/span><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/adage.com\/article\/digital\/reddit-s-newest-ad-type-pretty-hopes\/316422\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AdAge<\/span><\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Reddit&#8217;s ad revenue has grown five-times over the past three years. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #282828;font-size: 105%\">As it now branches into CPC advertising, Reddit could see this trend continue. Since ad spend is expected to increase in 2019 for big players like Facebook and Google, Reddit CPC ads could present advertisers with a lower-cost marketing alternative. The trade-off is, of course, Reddit has a smaller audience than the duopoly\u2019s billions of diverse users. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #282828;font-size: 105%\">That\u2019s not to say Reddit hasn\u2019t grown considerably since its inception in 2005. Dubbed \u201cthe front page of the internet,\u201d Reddit now has 330 million monthly active users around the world. Over half of these users are located in the United States. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #282828;font-size: 105%\"><strong>Who can I reach by running ads on Reddit?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #282828;font-size: 105%\">Despite its high volume of users, the demographic of Reddit\u2019s audience remains relatively narrow, with the majority of its users being young and male. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #282828;font-size: 105%\">In the United States, more than 50% of Reddit users fall into the 18-29 age bracket. Around two-thirds are male.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #282828;font-size: 105%\"><strong>What does this mean for marketers?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #282828;font-size: 105%\">Marketers with this target audience may look to shift some of their advertising dollars from Google or Facebook to Reddit. Those with a different or wider audience, however, may opt to stick with the duopoly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #282828;font-size: 105%\">Either way, Reddit\u2019s move into the CPC arena marks another example of smaller platforms battling for Google and Facebook ad dollars. Whether or not Reddit will be a viable contender, however, remains to be seen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #282828;font-size: 105%\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you need help with your paid advertising strategy, our team of experts at <span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/\">Creative Website Marketing<\/a><\/span> are happy to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">help<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and to provide access to the data you need to maximize your PPC investment.<strong> <span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/#contact\">Contact us<\/a><\/span> today!\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>Creative Website Marketing is a digital marketing agency in Nashville, TN, helping businesses throughout the country execute strategic brand awareness + lead generation efforts.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Reddit announced at the end of January that it will now be offering cost-per-click (CPC) ads in an effort to attract a wider variety of online marketers to the platform. \u00a0 What is Reddit?
