When setting up a search campaign, marketers must first consider the goal of the campaign. Are you looking to find customers for your product or service? Increase brand awareness? Drive new visitors to your website? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Your goal informs the rest of the structure and settings of the campaign, so it is essential to establish a clear objective before proceeding to the next steps. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If a company wants to achieve more than one goal with Google Ads, it&#8217;s best to create multiple campaigns, with each one focused on a specific goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Once marketers have set a clear goal, they should consider the additional settings of the campaign. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Geo-targeting, for example, is an important setting at the campaign level. Also called location targeting, this tool narrows down who sees your ads based on geographic area. Geo-targeting can be as broad as targeting individuals in a certain country, or as specific as targeting individuals searching within a particular postal code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This feature can expose your ad to the right individuals, helping to make the most of your PPC campaign. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Other campaign settings to consider include the bid strategy, language settings, conversion actions, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-5728 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ppc-statistic-2-2.gif\" alt=\"Google Ads is the most popular PPC network with digital advertisers\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Ad Groups<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The next area of focus when considering campaign structure is ad groups. Ad groups allow you to break your campaign into multiple categories, topics or themes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Since each ad group has its own keywords, targeting settings and ads, this lets you get more granular and specific within your campaign. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Thus, by creating ad groups, you can ensure the ads your audience ends up seeing are as relevant as possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Typically, the maximum number of ad groups for each search campaign should be 7 to 10, with around 20 keywords per ad group. Exceptions apply, of course, but for most businesses, these guidelines help ensure a campaign remains manageable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2622\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-7-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Account Structure Example\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-7-1024x512.png 1024w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-7-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-7-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2-7.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Keywords<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As noted above, each ad group contains its own specific set of keywords. Keywords are words or phrases people search for on Google. By adding a keyword, you&#8217;re telling Google you want your ad to show up when people search for that term.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">An important aspect of selecting keywords is considering the intent of the user. For example, imagine the goal of your campaign is to attract new customers to buy your product. Broad keywords, such as the name of a general product like <em>microwave<\/em>, often do not reflect what a user would search if they were intending to buy the product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Someone who is looking to buy a product would likely include additional details in their search, such as <em>best microwave brands<\/em> or <em>appliance stores near me<\/em>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Keywords that reflect intent to buy often include product details, brand names, the word \u201ccost,\u201d and location terms such as a specific city or the words \u201cnear me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">To determine the most effective keywords for each ad group, keyword research is vital. In addition to Google\u2019s Keyword Planner, a variety of tools exist to aid in keyword research. Marketers can take advantage of free tools, such as <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #0763a8;\">Wordstream&#8217;s Free Keyword Planner<\/span><\/a>, or opt for paid tools like <span style=\"color: #0763a8;\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEM Rush<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/ppc-management\/#roi-calculator\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button primary is-outline primary is-medium\"  >\n    <span>ROI Calculator for PPC Campaigns<\/span>\n  <\/a>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Ad Copy<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Once you&#8217;ve decided which keywords to target, you&#8217;ll need to create your ads.
