Google determines this by the formula: Clicks \/ Impressions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">But what does CTR mean in the context of your PPC campaign? Basically, this metric indicates whether or not your ads are enticing users to click through to your site. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The average CTR varies by industry. To view industry benchmarks and see how your CTR compares, check out <span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this list from WordStream<\/a><\/span> <\/span>of average click-through rates in Google Ads by industry.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>What does a low CTR mean? <\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Is your CTR low compared to industry averages? A below-average CTR signals a few things. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">good news<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is that your ads are getting impressions. This means that you\u2019ve done a good job with bidding, keyword selection, and other factors that determine whether or not your ads show up on the Google search engine results page (SERP). <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">However, even though users are seeing your ad, they are not clicking it. When your goal is to drive traffic to your website, this is a problem. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Luckily, there are strategies to help increase CTR in your PPC campaigns. Often, it only takes a few tweaks to see improvement.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>How can I increase CTR in my Google Ads account?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2560\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CTR-Blog-Graphic-1.png\" alt=\"How to Increase CTR (Clickthrough Rate)\" width=\"735\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CTR-Blog-Graphic-1.png 1000w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CTR-Blog-Graphic-1-300x180.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CTR-Blog-Graphic-1-768x461.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>1. Make sure the right people see your ad<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When running a Google Ads campaign, you want your ad to show up, but not to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">everyone<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Ideally, Google should only show your ad to your<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">target audience\u2013 people likely to be interested in and engage with your brand.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>Targeting<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is a powerful and easy tool to ensure your ads reach the right users. Google Ads offers a variety of targeting methods, from location targeting (also called geo-targeting) to targeting by demographics and income level.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">More advanced options like remarketing and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2019\/04\/23\/what-are-custom-intent-audiences-in-google-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custom intent audiences<\/a><\/span><\/span> let PPC advertisers further hone in on their target audience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For search campaigns, <\/span><b>negative keywords<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are another method for weeding out irrelevant searches that may trigger your ads. You can use the Search Terms Report in Google Ads to see what search queries have caused your ads to appear on the SERP. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you see irrelevant terms that don\u2019t align with your products or services, add them to your negative keyword list. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once you do that, your ads will no longer show up for search queries that include those negative keywords.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">So how do targeting and negative keywords help CTR? When your ads stop appearing to users with no interest in your product, and start appearing to the people they\u2019re meant to engage, your CTR will undoubtedly improve.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">2. Use ad extensions\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Extensions can help boost your Google Ads CTR in several ways. First, extensions increase the real estate your ad takes up on the SERP. Your ad becomes more dominant on the page, making users more likely to notice, read, and click the ad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Plus, ad extensions provide additional information about your business beyond your ad\u2019s headlines and descriptions. Any piece of this added information may resonate with a consumer, enticing them to click through to your site when they may have otherwise kept scrolling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Furthermore, because ad formatting factors into Quality Score, utilizing ad extensions can also help boost ad rank. The higher you rank on Google, the more likely users are to click on your ad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, according to Google,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">there is on average a 10-15% increase in CTR after implementing a new ad extension. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This varies by industry and other factors, of course. For instance, PPC Hero\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ran a test where they added callout extensions to an eCommerce account in Google Ads. In just 30 days, this led to a staggering <\/span>221% increase in CTR.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Although this won\u2019t be the outcome for every campaign that uses extensions (if only!), data supports the value of this ad formatting option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">However, don\u2019t stick an extension onto your ad just to have it there. Be intentional about which extensions you apply, and know the value it brings to your target audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, learn about the <\/span><span style=\"color: #0763a8\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2019\/03\/27\/5-google-ad-extensions-to-enhance-ppc-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">5 ad extensions we recommend to help increase your CTR<\/span><\/span><\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>3. Insert a call to action<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">We are huge advocates for including a call to action (CTA) in your ad. This may seem like common sense, but it can be easy to focus your ad copy so much on your product or service that you overlook including a CTA. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">It\u2019s crucial to direct your audience to take the next step in their customer journey. In order to do that, you must clearly state what the step is. For example:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Shop Now<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Learn More<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Visit Us Today<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Sign Up Now<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Schedule An Appointment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Download Your Free Ebook<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">Include your CTA in the headline, and reiterate it in the description. Make it clear to the customer that you can meet their needs, and illuminate the action they need to take in order to obtain your product or service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">When you encourage the user to take a concrete action, he or she is more likely to follow through and click on your ad\u2013 leading to increased CTRs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;color: #000000\">And of course, once you win the click from users, you want to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline\"><a style=\"color: #0763a8;text-decoration: underline\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/2019\/04\/03\/4-keys-to-creating-landing-pages-that-convert\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">be sure your landing page is designed to convert<\/a><\/span>.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Need more help optimizing your PPC campaigns?
