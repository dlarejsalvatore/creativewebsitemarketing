While blog posts are effective tools to help build and reinforce a company\u2019s online presence, other formats have emerged in recent years that brands should begin to explore and capitalize on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">We\u2019ve all watched as social media has revolutionized the Internet, and marketers have taken note. For several years, companies have used social media to encourage consumers to interact with their brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Throughout these years, one type of post has distinguished itself as particularly effective at engaging consumers, sparking a recent trend among online marketers that emphasizes this type of content on social media and beyond.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-358 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Infographics.png\" alt=\"Infographics header\" width=\"820\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Infographics.png 820w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Infographics-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Infographics-768x292.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">Infographics<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Visual content has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years; <strong>infographics<\/strong> in particular have become a favorite medium among online marketers. Infographics offer a visual, creative, and concise way to convey information. According to <span style=\"color: #000080\"><a style=\"color: #000080\" href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/cherylsnappconner\/2017\/10\/19\/the-data-is-in-infographics-are-growing-and-thriving-in-2017-and-beyond\/#6010ac0d137c\">Forbes<\/a><\/span>, 84% of marketers who have used infographics consider them an effective tool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Infographics incorporate visual aids such as icons, graphs, images, and flow charts. By transforming data into a visual story, infographics simplify information and deliver it in an appealing and understandable manner. Online marketers can utilize this type of content to, for example, summarize a blog post, explain how to use a product, compare two types of services, or illustrate results from a customer satisfaction survey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-360 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Video.png\" alt=\"Video header\" width=\"820\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Video.png 820w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Video-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Video-768x292.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">Video<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">In addition to infographics, <strong>video<\/strong> has surfaced as an increasingly popular type of visual online content. Live video in particular is being heralded as an up-and-coming medium. In a world where it\u2019s sometimes difficult to tell the difference between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s manufactured, live video, which streams in real-time, has a sense of authenticity that appeals to viewers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Companies looking to capitalize on the rise of video should create interesting videos that align with their brand and relate to consumers. For example, a short live video of employees brainstorming during a meeting could make a fun Facebook post that highlights your company\u2019s personality, while also hinting at your creative process. A recorded video of a customer giving positive testimony about your brand could supplement a new blog post about the company\u2019s commitment to customer service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-359 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Podcasts.png\" alt=\"Podcasts header\" width=\"820\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Podcasts.png 820w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Podcasts-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Podcasts-768x292.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">Podcasts<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Visual content does not represent the only format becoming increasingly prevalent among marketers, however. <strong>Podcasts<\/strong> rely on auditory content to connect with consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Podcasts integrate commentary and conversation into different \u201cepisodes\u201d that focus on various topics, all of which relate to an overall theme\u2014for example, a shoe company with a podcast might have episodes highlighting new fashion trends, NBA players who design their own shoes, and the most popular shoes throughout different eras of history.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Although podcasts typically have one or two consistent hosts, the episodes can feature interviews with guests and other creative forms of engagement. Hosts can even answer questions that listeners of the podcast pose on Twitter or Facebook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Podcasts can be streamed or downloaded by consumers, who can listen to episodes in the car, during downtime at work, or while walking around the neighborhood. This form of content can increase your brand awareness by engaging those interested in the topics you cover, and exposing them to your company as a result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">These various tools have emerged in recent years, providing companies the chance to expand into new and creative territories. To gain a competitive edge, your brand should begin capitalizing on these new opportunities as a supplement to the content you may already be producing, such as blog posts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Regardless of which tools you choose to delve into, be sure to keep your marketing strategy and branding <strong>consistent<\/strong> among all platforms and formats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">To learn more about digital strategy or for a free digital audit, contact Creative Website Marketing <strong><span style=\"color: #000080\"><a style=\"color: #000080\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/#contact\">here<\/a><\/span>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>Creative Website Marketing is a digital marketing agency in Nashville, TN, helping businesses throughout the country execute strategic brand awareness + lead generation efforts.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Creating online content does not always equate to writing online content.
