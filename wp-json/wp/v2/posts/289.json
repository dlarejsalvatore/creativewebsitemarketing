Answer These 5 Questions To Find Out"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">If your business doesn&#8217;t specialize in digital marketing, it can be difficult to measure whether or not your in-house advertising efforts are paying off. The following 5 questions can help you determine how effective your current online marketing strategies are, as well as offering tips &amp; tools for boosting results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>1. What can a prospect find out about you from a single brand search on Google?\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Open a Private Window from Safari or a New Incognito Window in Chrome, and search your company\u2019s name on Google. Don\u2019t include the company location or additional keywords. An incognito search will show what your customers are seeing, as it doesn\u2019t take into account your computer&#8217;s search history.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Ideally, your search will include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Your website ranked #1 or 2 on the first page<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Your Google My Business listing<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">3 to 5 of your social media pages or other online platforms<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">If your brand search doesn\u2019t produce these results, there are several possible reasons as to why:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Your website needs an SEO boost<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Google thinks the content on your website isn\u2019t relevant to the product or service you offer<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Your website isn\u2019t mobile friendly (making it responsive will help)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Your Google My Business listing isn\u2019t claimed and optimized<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Your business isn\u2019t on social media<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Your social media profiles are not up-to-date<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">When your brand is searched online, the goal is for your brand to take up the most real estate as possible on the 1st page of results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>2. How much content are you producing on a weekly basis?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Whether you\u2019re B2B or B2C, creating lots of content can have an enormous impact on growing your online presence. Types of content to share include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Blogs (publish on your website, then share throughout your social media platforms)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Company Updates<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Achievements<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Stories<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Pictures<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Videos<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Infographics<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000\">Team Member Bios (human factor)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">Take inventory of how much you\u2019re currently producing and sharing on a weekly basis. Multiply by 4 to get your monthly total and then by 52 for a yearly total. Given that everything you share online is helping to advertise your brand, and most likely you\u2019re using FREE platforms, are you happy with how you are utilizing social media and online platforms from a content standpoint? Take advantage!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>3. What online platforms can your brand be found advertising on?\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">First off, make sure you\u2019re targeting platforms where your customers can be found. Online platforms doesn\u2019t mean just social media. It also includes Google My Business, Bing Places for Business, Yellow Pages, Better Business Bureau, Wikipedia, etc. Use the image below to determine which platforms are right for your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><img class=\"wp-image-298 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/14602224496_c3cebc398b_b-1024x791.jpg\" alt=\"Social Media apps\" width=\"637\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/14602224496_c3cebc398b_b.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/14602224496_c3cebc398b_b-300x232.jpg 300w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/14602224496_c3cebc398b_b-768x593.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><b>4.
