As a business, y<\/span>ou want to make a smart investment and ensure your brand is in good hands. However, you may have multiple agencies to choose from, and it can be hard to know exactly which services you need or who can offer the most competitive strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">As a result, you may not know which agency is the best fit for your particular needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Luckily, there are some key factors to look for that can lead you to the right choice. The following 5 areas of consideration can help you evaluate different digital marketing agencies and determine which one can best meet your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Whether you\u2019re a small business or large corporation, consider the following 5 factors when choosing a digital marketing agency.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-907040965\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-100605353\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner text-center\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"img has-hover x md-x lg-x y md-y lg-y\" id=\"image_172125278\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"img-inner dark\" >\n\t\t\t<img width=\"1020\" height=\"574\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/how-to-choose-a-digital-marketing-agency.gif\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"How to choose a digital marketing agency\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<style>\n#image_172125278 {\n  width: 75%;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n\t<div id=\"gap-907652243\" class=\"gap-element clearfix\" style=\"display:block; height:auto;\">\n\t\t\n<style>\n#gap-907652243 {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-1509352579\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-1064143826\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b style=\"color: #000000;\">1. Services and Expertise<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Online marketing encompasses a broad range of service areas. Some agencies are full-service, meaning they provide everything from social media management to email marketing. Other agencies focus on specific service areas, such as <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/what-do-ppc-management-companies-do\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC Management<\/a><\/span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Thus, when choosing a digital marketing agency, it\u2019s important to understand which services the agency provides. Do their service offerings align with your goals?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">For example, if you want to increase organic traffic and keyword rankings, an agency that specializes in SEO services would probably be a better fit than a company whose primary focus is email marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Furthermore, ensure that the agency not only provides the service you\u2019re looking for, but demonstrates expertise in that area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">An agency may offer a variety of services, but which ones are their bread and butter? What do they truly specialize in? This is important because you want to be sure you\u2019re hiring a team of experts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">For instance, an agency that specializes in one service may be a better fit than a full-service option if they have the knowledge it takes to bring innovative strategies to the table and make your company competitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Likewise, if an agency\u2019s areas of expertise don\u2019t line up with the services you need, it might not be the right fit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">To determine a digital marketing company\u2019s level of expertise, you can look for certain qualifications such as being Google Ads certified, a Facebook marketing partner, or a HubSpot certified partner. These are by no means a requirement. However, they can help increase your confidence that an agency has the expertise you\u2019re looking for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">To further assess an agency\u2019s level of expertise, note how comfortable they are discussing their services. For example:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Are they able to answer your questions?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Can they explain technical concepts in a simplified, easy to understand way?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Have they encountered your pain points before?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Do they make the connection between their services and your business goals?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Prioritize agencies that demonstrate a thorough understanding of the services you need. By doing so, you will be better positioned to choose a digital marketing agency that can deliver results and help you meet your business goals.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-1435902697\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-2110309093\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner text-center\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"img has-hover x md-x lg-x y md-y lg-y\" id=\"image_460185510\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"img-inner dark\" >\n\t\t\t<img width=\"1020\" height=\"574\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ppc-statistic-business.gif\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"PPC statistic\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<style>\n#image_460185510 {\n  width: 75%;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n\t<div id=\"gap-2082531836\" class=\"gap-element clearfix\" style=\"display:block; height:auto;\">\n\t\t\n<style>\n#gap-2082531836 {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-610234323\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-1605154378\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>2. Knowledge of Your Business<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">In addition to specializing in the services you need, digital marketing agencies need to understand your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Industry experience is a plus. Having worked with other businesses in your field, the agency will be familiar with the unique challenges and landscape of your industry. They may also be able to apply strategies to your business that have worked for others in the industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">However, every company is different\u2013 even ones in the same industry. Tactics that worked for one of your competitors may not necessarily be right for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Therefore, even more important than industry experience is an agency\u2019s willingness to get to know your specific business. They should ask questions about your goals, your brand, your target audience, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">All of this develops into a picture of what success looks like for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Why is this important? Ideally, you don\u2019t want a cookie cutter approach. Instead, you want a custom strategy tailored to your company. Your unique needs and KPIs should inform the agency\u2019s approach from the very beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">That way, your digital marketing efforts sync up with your business goals. Your strategy, your messaging, and your objectives are aligned. As a result, you\u2019re more likely to achieve the outcomes you desire.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-1041936082\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-1269871539\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner text-center\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/5-benefits-of-hiring-a-digital-marketing-agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button primary is-outline lowercase\"  >\n    <span>5 Benefits of Hiring a Digital Marketing Agency<\/span>\n  <\/a>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-614265842\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-1888292578\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>3. Good Communication<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Another consideration when choosing a digital marketing agency is communication. As with any working relationship, communication is key. If you want to launch a new initiative quickly or if a time-sensitive issue arises, you\u2019re going to want an agency partner that\u2019s responsive and ready to work with you to find a solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">To evaluate the communication style of a marketing agency, take note of how easy it is to get in touch with them. Is it a chore? Does it take multiple emails to get a response?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">It\u2019s a bit too much to ask for an immediate reply every time you reach out. However, if you have to send three emails and leave a voicemail before they get back to you, that\u2019s not a good sign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">In addition to response time, pay attention to their approach to customer service. For example:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Are they willing to answer questions?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Do team members demonstrate flexibility?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Is this a group of people you would enjoy working with?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Furthermore, an agency should be able to communicate their services in a way you can understand. Digital marketing is a complicated industry with a lot of jargon and specializations. It\u2019s important to find an agency who can explain complex terms and concepts in an understandable manner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">That way, you are informed about the marketing tactics the agency uses. Perhaps more importantly, you\u2019ll understand how those tactics help accomplish your business goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Without good communication, a disconnect can occur between your business and the online marketing agency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">For example, the agency may end up implementing tactics that don\u2019t serve your business goals. If they are unresponsive and lack good customer service, you may have a difficult time remedying this problem. Or, if they haven\u2019t clearly communicated the services they\u2019re providing, you may not even know the marketing efforts aren\u2019t aligned with your goals. Meanwhile, you\u2019re paying for services that don\u2019t benefit your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Therefore, communication is a crucial consideration when choosing a digital marketing agency.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-1006299384\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-486957932\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner text-center\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"img has-hover x md-x lg-x y md-y lg-y\" id=\"image_1384038467\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"img-inner dark\" >\n\t\t\t<img width=\"1020\" height=\"574\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/communication-statistic.gif\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"Communication statistic\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<style>\n#image_1384038467 {\n  width: 75%;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n\t<div id=\"gap-598432160\" class=\"gap-element clearfix\" style=\"display:block; height:auto;\">\n\t\t\n<style>\n#gap-598432160 {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-243645126\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-1294212399\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>4. Reviews and Testimonials<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">When wondering how to choose a digital marketing agency, reviews and testimonials are helpful tools. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Today&#8217;s consumers have come to rely on reviews as part of their purchasing process. In fact, according to the <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu\/online-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spiegel Research Center<\/a><\/span>, around 95% of customers read reviews before making a purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Although researching marketing agencies is different than shopping for a new coffee maker or pair of running shoes, reviews can still be useful in helping you evaluate your various options.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Google My Business is often a great place to start. These reviews are easy to find and can give insight into the experience of working with a certain agency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The number of reviews for each agency will depend on their size, how long they\u2019ve been in business, and other factors. However, the content of the reviews holds the most value. Are they generally positive? Are customers satisfied? What details are included that might help set an agency apart?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">In addition to Google reviews, many digital marketing companies will feature testimonials on their website. While these quotes are typically hand-picked to show an agency in the best light, it can still be helpful to browse testimonials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Furthermore, case studies can be helpful sources of information. As opposed to most testimonials, case studies provide data to show that the agency has produced measurable results for their clients. This can be especially useful if the case study relates to your industry, company size, or market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Trust signals like reviews and testimonials can be a great way to sort through different agencies and get a sense of what their customers have to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Keep in mind, however, that a five-star rating doesn\u2019t automatically mean an agency is the best fit for your business. Thus, it\u2019s important not to rely solely on reviews and incorporate other factors into your decision.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-481253524\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-1319862952\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner text-center\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t<div class=\"img has-hover x md-x lg-x y md-y lg-y\" id=\"image_2052058750\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"img-inner dark\" >\n\t\t\t<img width=\"1020\" height=\"574\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/reviews-statistic.gif\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"Reviews statistic\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<style>\n#image_2052058750 {\n  width: 75%;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n\t<div id=\"gap-1013839050\" class=\"gap-element clearfix\" style=\"display:block; height:auto;\">\n\t\t\n<style>\n#gap-1013839050 {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n<div class=\"row\"  id=\"row-2136029412\">\n\n\t<div id=\"col-1512910127\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>5. Realistic Expectations<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">When you are deciding which digital marketing agency to hire, be aware of the expectations they are setting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">A top-notch agency will set clear expectations with you. They will be transparent about things like pricing, scope of services, timeframe, and deliverables.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, they should be straightforward about the results you can expect from their services. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be wary of agencies that overpromise or guarantee results that sound too good to be true. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if an agency says they can double your organic traffic overnight or dramatically increase email subscribers right off the bat, that\u2019s a red flag.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Having an agency guarantee amazing results may sound enticing at first. However, promises of rapid, extreme growth can indicate deceptive and unethical practices\u2013 or plain dishonesty. When you\u2019re looking for a strong, viable, and long-term agency partnership, those are qualities you want to steer clear of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Not only are shady marketing techniques unethical, they\u2019re often ineffective and unsustainable. Google and other search engines are aware of these techniques and have grown sophisticated enough to recognize them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">In fact, Google will penalize websites for things like keyword stuffing, cloaking, and other \u201cblack hat\u201d marketing tactics. Once your website has been flagged for such practices, it can be difficult to recover.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Data and privacy is another consideration. This is a huge focus area right now, and abusing user data or violating privacy policies in online marketing is very serious. For this reason alone, you do not want to get involved with an agency engaged in unethical, deceptive, or manipulative practices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Instead, you want a trustworthy agency acting on your behalf.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Look for agencies who are honest about what they provide and the results you can expect. Digital marketing isn\u2019t an overnight fix in most cases, especially in areas like SEO and content marketing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">That\u2019s not to say that agencies can never produce quick results.
