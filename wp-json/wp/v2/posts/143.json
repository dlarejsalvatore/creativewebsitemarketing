If you\u2019ve recently started a business or are in need of growing your digital presence, this is a great place to start. Bing Places for Business mimics GMB, but of course will display on Bing\u2019s search engine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GMB is also known as the google knowledge panel. When a prospect or customer performs a brand search (your company name + location) it should display your business in the top right-hand corner of the page, ultimately giving the user a first impression of your business&#8230;before visiting your website. There are more in-depth features which we\u2019ve outlined below, but let\u2019s address the basic features first:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Displaying photos of your logo, employees, building, services, inventory, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The service you offer<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Phone number<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Website link<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Directions link<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hours<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Why should you be optimizing GMB? Here are 4 great reasons.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><b>Reviews<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. If you\u2019ve already made a great first impression but your prospect is still evaluating your brand, it\u2019s now your job to gain their trust. GMB displays your customer reviews, which are sure to help (if they\u2019re not positive we can help change that).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Posts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Google just released this feature and it allows you to create a \u2018post\u2019 which appears on your listing giving you the option to advertise specials, sales, discounts, events, etc. This is a solid feature as it&#8217;s a great display advertising method to use before a customer even clicks on your website, see an example below:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-154 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Google-My-Business-GMB-Post-Creative-Website-Marketing.png\" alt=\"Google My Business Post\" width=\"540\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Google-My-Business-GMB-Post-Creative-Website-Marketing.png 540w, https:\/\/creativewebsitemarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Google-My-Business-GMB-Post-Creative-Website-Marketing-260x300.png 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Message Button<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

This is currently a mobile only feature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Link Other Social Media Pages<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.
